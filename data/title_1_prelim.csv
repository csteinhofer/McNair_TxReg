(4) Corporation--The term does not include professional  corporations or professional associations.  (5) Election cycle--A single election and any related  primary or runoff election.  (6) Identified measure--A question or proposal submitted  in an election for an expression of the voters' will and includes  the circulation and submission of a petition to determine whether  a question or proposal is required to be submitted in an election  for an expression of the voters' will.  (7) Non-political expenditure--An expenditure from  political contributions that is not an officeholder expenditure or  a campaign expenditure.  (8) Opposed candidate--A candidate who has an opponent  whose name is to appear on the ballot. The name of a write-in candidate  does not appear on the ballot.  (9) Out-of-state political committee--A political committee  that makes political expenditures outside Texas and in the 12 months  immediately preceding the making of a political expenditure by the  committee inside Texas (other than an expenditure made in connection  with a campaign for a federal office or made for a federal officeholder),  makes 80% or more of the committee's total political expenditures  in any combination of elections outside this state and federal offices  not voted on in this state. Section 20.13 of this title (relating  to Out-of-State Committees) explains the practical application of  this definition.  (10) Pledge--A contribution in the form of an unfulfilled  promise or unfulfilled agreement, whether enforceable or not, to provide  a specified amount of money or specific goods or services. The term  does not include a contribution actually made in the form of a check.  (11) Political advertising: (A) A communication that supports or opposes a political  party, a public officer, a measure, or a candidate for nomination  or election to a public office or office of a political party, and: (i) is published in a newspaper, magazine, or other  periodical in return for consideration; (ii) is broadcast by radio or television in return  for consideration; (iii) appears in a pamphlet, circular, flier, billboard,  or other sign, bumper sticker, or similar form of written communication;  or (iv) appears on an Internet website.

(12) Political subdivision--A county, city, or school  district or any other governmental entity that:  (A) embraces a geographic area with a defined boundary;  (B) exists for the purpose of discharging functions  of government; and  (C) possesses authority for subordinate self-government  through officers selected by it.  (13) Report--Any document required to be filed by this  title, including an appointment of campaign treasurer, any type of  report of contributions and expenditures, and any notice.  (14) Special pre-election report--A shorthand term  for a report filed in accordance with the requirements of §§20.221,  20.333, or 20.435 of this title (relating to Special Pre-Election  Report by Certain Candidates; Special Pre-Election Report by Certain  Specific-Purpose Committees; Special Pre-Election Reports by Certain  General-Purpose Committees) and §§254.038 and §254.039  of the Election Code (relating to Special Report Near Election by  Certain Candidates and Political Committees and Special Report Near  Election By Certain General-Purpose Committees).  (15) Specific-purpose committee--A political committee  that does not meet the definition of general-purpose committee and  that has among its principal purposes:  (A) supporting or opposing one or more:  (i) candidates, all of whom are identified and are  seeking offices that are known; or  (ii) measures, all of which are identified;  (B) assisting one or more officeholders, all of whom  are identified; or  (C) supporting or opposing only one candidate who is  unidentified or who is seeking an office that is unknown.  (16) Unidentified measure--A question or proposal that  is intended to be submitted in an election for an expression of the  voters' will and that is not yet legally required to be submitted  in an election, except that the term does not include the circulation  or submission of a petition to determine whether a question or proposal  is required to be submitted in an election for an expression of the  voters' will. The circulation or submission of a petition to determine  whether a question or proposal is required to be submitted in an election  for an expression of the voters' will is considered to be an identified  measure.  (17) Principal purpose--A group has as a principal  purpose of accepting political contributions or making political expenditures,  including direct campaign expenditures, when that activity is an important  or a main function of the group.  (A) A group may have more than one principal purpose.  (B) A group has as a principal purpose accepting political  contributions if the proportion of the political contributions to  the total contributions to the group is more than 25 percent within  a calendar year. A contributor intends to make a political contribution  if the solicitations that prompted the contribution or the statements  made by the contributor about the contribution would lead to no other  reasonable conclusion than that the contribution was intended to be  a political contribution.  (C) The group may maintain specific evidence of contributions  related only to political contributions or only to nonpolitical contributions.  For example, the group may ask the contributor to make an indication  when the contribution is made that the contribution is only a nonpolitical  contribution.  (D) A group has as a principal purpose making political  expenditures, including direct expenditures, if the group expends  more than 25 percent of its annual expenses to make political expenditures  within a calendar year. The following shall be included for purposes  of calculating the threshold:  (i) the amount of money paid in compensation and benefits  to the group's employees for work related to making political expenditures;  (ii) the amount of money spent on political expenditures;  and  (iii) the amount of money attributable to the proportional  share of administrative expenses related to political expenditures.  The proportional share of administrative expenses is calculated by  comparing the political expenditures in clause (ii) of this subparagraph  with nonpolitical expenditures. (For example, if the group sends three  mailings a year and each costs $10,000, if the first two are issue  based newsletters and the third is a direct advocacy sample ballot,  and there were no other outside expenditures, then the proportion  of the administrative expenses attributable to political expenditures  would be 33%.) Administrative expenses include:  (I) fees for services to non-employees;  (II) advertising and promotion;  (III) office expenses;  (IV) information technology;  (V) occupancy;  (VI) travel expenses;  (VII) interest; and  (VIII) insurance.  (E) The group may maintain specific evidence of administrative  expenses related only to political expenditures or only to nonpolitical  expenditures. Specifically identified administrative expenses shall  not be included in the proportion established by subparagraph (D)(iii)  but allocated by the actual amount of the expense.  (F) In this section, the term ""political expenditures""  includes direct campaign expenditures.  (18) In connection with a campaign:  (A) An expenditure is made in connection with a campaign  for an elective office if it is:  (i) made for a communication that expressly advocates  the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate by:  (I) using such words as ""vote for,"" ""elect,"" ""support,""  ""vote against,"" ""defeat,"" ""reject,"" ""cast your ballot for,"" or ""Smith  for city council;"" or  (II) using such phrases as ""elect the incumbent"" or  ""reject the challenger,"" or such phrases as ""vote pro-life"" or ""vote  pro-choice"" accompanied by a listing of candidates described as ""pro-life""  or ""pro-choice;""  (ii) made for a communication broadcast by radio, television,  cable, or satellite or distributed by print or electronic media, including  any print publication, mailing, Internet website, electronic mail,  or automated phone bank, that:  (I) refers to a clearly identified candidate;  (II) is distributed within 30 days before a contested  election for the office sought by the candidate;  (III) targets a mass audience or group in the geographical  area the candidate seeks to represent; and  (IV) includes words, whether displayed, written, or  spoken; images of the candidate or candidate's opponent; or sounds  of the voice of the candidate or candidate's opponent that, without  consideration of the intent of the person making the communication,  are susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation than to urge  the election or defeat of the candidate;  (iii) made by a candidate or political committee to  support or oppose a candidate; or  (iv) a campaign contribution to:  (I) a candidate; or  (II) a group that, at the time of the contribution,  already qualifies as a political committee.  (B) An expenditure is made in connection with a campaign  on a measure if it is:  (i) made for a communication that expressly advocates  the passage or defeat of a clearly identified measure by using such  words as ""vote for,"" ""support,"" ""vote against,"" ""defeat,"" ""reject,""  or ""cast your ballot for;""  (ii) made for a communication broadcast by radio, television,  cable, or satellite or distributed by print or electronic media, including  any print publication, mailing, Internet website, electronic mail,  or automated phone bank, that:  (I) refers to a clearly identified measure;  (II) is distributed within 30 days before the election  in which the measure is to appear on the ballot;  (III) targets a mass audience or group in the geographical  area in which the measure is to appear on the ballot; and  (IV) includes words, whether displayed, written, or  spoken, that, without consideration of the intent of the person making  the communication, are susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation  than to urge the passage or defeat of the measure;  (iii) made by a political committee to support or oppose  a measure; or  (iv) a campaign contribution to a group that, at the  time of the contribution, already qualifies as a political committee.  (C) Any cost incurred for covering or carrying a news  story, commentary, or editorial by a broadcasting station or cable  television operator, Internet website, or newspaper, magazine, or  other periodical publication, including an Internet or other electronic  publication, is not a campaign expenditure if the cost for the news  story, commentary, or editorial is not paid for by, and the medium  is not owned or controlled by, a candidate or political committee.  (D) For purposes of this section:  (i) a candidate is clearly identified by a communication  that includes the candidate's name, office sought, office held, likeness,  photograph, or other apparent and unambiguous reference; and  (ii) a measure is clearly identified by a communication  that includes the measure's name or ballot designation (such as ""Proposition  1""), purposes, election date, or other apparent and unambiguous reference.  (19) Discount--The provision of any goods or services  without charge or at a charge which is less than fair market value.  A discount is an in-kind political contribution unless the terms of  the transaction reflect the usual and normal practice of the industry  and are typical of the terms that are offered to political and non-political  persons alike, or unless the discount is given solely in order to  comply with §253.041 of the Election Code. The value of an in-kind  contribution in the form of a discount is the difference between Cont'd..."

The following words and terms, when  used in this section, shall have the following meanings, unless the  context clearly indicates otherwise. (1) Attorney general--The Office of the Attorney General  of Texas, acting through the Bankruptcy and Collections Division of  the agency. (2) Debtor--Any person or entity liable or potentially  liable for an obligation owed to the state or a state agency or against  whom a claim or demand for payment has been made. (3) Delinquent--Payment is past due by law or by customary  business practice, and all conditions precedent to payment have occurred  or been performed. (4) Make demand--To deliver or cause to be delivered  by United States mail, first class, a writing setting forth the nature  and amount of the obligation owed to the agency. A writing making  demand is a ""demand letter."" (5) Obligation--A debt, judgment, claim, account, fee,  fine, tax, penalty, interest, loan, charge, or grant. (6) Security--Any right to have property owned by an  entity with an obligation to a state agency sold or forfeited in satisfaction  of the obligation; and any instrument granting a cause of action in  favor of the State of Texas and/or the agency against another entity  and/or that entity's property, such as a bond, letter of credit, or  other collateral that has been pledged to the agency to secure an  obligation. (7) State agency--Any agency, board, commission, institution,  or other unit of state government. (b) Uniform guidelines for state agencies in collecting  delinquent obligations. (1) A state agency shall adopt procedures to establish  and determine the liability of each person responsible for the obligation,  whether that liability can be established by statutory or common law.  Agency records shall contain and reflect the identity of all persons  liable on the obligation or any part thereof. All agency collection  procedures shall apply to every debtor, subject to reasonable tolerances  established by the agency. (See paragraph (8) of this subsection.) (2) A state agency shall adopt procedures to ensure  that agency records reflect the correct physical address of the debtor's  place of business, and, where applicable, the debtor's residence.  Where a fiduciary or trust relationship exists between the agency  (or the state) as principal and the debtor as trustee, an accurate  physical address shall be maintained. A post office box address should  not be used. Agency records may reflect a post office box where it  is impractical to obtain a physical address, or where the post office  box address is in addition to a correct physical address maintained  on the agency's books and records. (3) All demand letters should be mailed in an envelope  bearing the notation ""address correction requested"" in conformity  with 39 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter III, Subchapter A, Part  3001, Subpart C, Appendix A, §911. If an address correction is  provided by the United States Postal Service, the demand letter should  be re-sent to that address prior to the referral procedures described  herein. Demand should be made upon every debtor prior to referral  of the account to the attorney general. The final demand letter should  include a statement, where practical, that the debt, if not paid,  will be referred to the attorney general. (4) Where state law allows an agency to record a lien  securing the obligation, the agency shall file the lien in the appropriate  records of the county where the debtor's principal place of business,  or, where appropriate, the debtor's residence, is located or in such  county as may be required by law. The lien shall be filed as soon  as the obligation becomes delinquent or as soon as is practicable.  After referral of the delinquency to the attorney general, any lien  securing the indebtedness may not be released, except on full payment  of the obligation, without the approval of the attorney representing  the agency in the matter. (5) Where practicable, agencies shall maintain individual  collection histories of each account in order to document attempted  contacts with the debtor, the substance of communications with the  debtor, efforts to locate the debtor and his assets, and other information  pertinent to collection of the delinquent account. (6) Prior to referral of the obligation to the attorney  general, the agency shall: (A) verify the debtor's address and telephone number; (B) transmit no more than two demand letters to the  debtor at the debtor's verified address. The first demand letter should  be sent no later than 30 days after the obligation becomes delinquent.  The second demand letter should be sent no sooner than 30 days, but  not more than 60 days, after the first demand letter. Where agency  procedures, statutory mandates, or the requirements of this section  indicate that a lawsuit on the account may be filed by the Attorney  General, the demand letters shall so indicate; (C) verify that the obligation is not legally uncollectible  or uncollectible as a practical matter. Agencies shall adopt procedures  to ensure that referred obligations are not uncollectible. By way  of example, the following illustrations apply. (i) Bankruptcy. Agencies should prepare and timely  file a proof of claim, when appropriate, in the bankruptcy case of  each debtor, subject to reasonable tolerances adopted by the agency.  Copies of all such proofs of claims filed should be sent to the attorney  general absent the granting of a variance. Agencies shall maintain  records of notices of bankruptcy filings, dismissals and discharge  orders received from the United States bankruptcy courts to enable  the agency to ascertain whether the collection of the claim is subject  to the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code or whether  the debt has been discharged. Agencies may seek the assistance of  the attorney general in bankruptcy collection matters where necessary,  including the filing of a notice of appearance and preparation of  a proof of claim. (ii) Limitations. If the obligation is subject to an  applicable limitations provision that would prevent suit as a matter  of law, the obligation should not be referred unless circumstances  indicate that limitations has been tolled or is otherwise inapplicable. (iii) Corporations. If a corporation has been dissolved,  has been in liquidation under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy  Code, or has forfeited its corporate privileges or charter, or, in  the case of a foreign corporation, had its certificate of authority  revoked, the obligation should be referred unless circumstances indicate  that the account is clearly uncollectible. (iv) Out-of-state debtors. If the debtor is an individual  and is located out-of-state, or outside the United States, the matter  should not be referred unless a determination is made that the domestication  of a Texas judgment in the foreign forum would more likely than not  result in collection of the obligation, or that the expenditure of  agency funds to retain foreign counsel to domesticate the judgment  and proceed with collection attempts is justified. (v) Deceased debtors. If the debtor is deceased, agencies  should file a claim in each probate proceeding administering the decedent's  estate. If such probate proceeding has concluded and there are no  remaining assets of the decedent available for distribution, the delinquent  obligation should be classified as uncollectible and not be referred.  In cases where a probate administration is pending, or where no administration  has been opened, all referred obligations should include an explanation  of any circumstances indicating that the decedent has assets available  to apply toward satisfaction of the obligation. (7) Not later than the 90th day after the date an obligation  becomes delinquent, the agency shall report the uncollected and delinquent  obligation to the attorney general for further collection efforts  as hereinafter provided. See §2107.003, Texas Government Code. (8) Agencies shall adopt reasonable tolerances, subject  to review by the attorney general, below which an obligation shall  not be referred. Factors to be considered in establishing tolerances  include the size of the debt; the existence of any security; the likelihood  of collection through passive means such as the filing of a lien where  applicable; expense to the agency and to the attorney general in attempting  to collect the obligation; and the availability of resources both  within the agency and within the Office of the Attorney General to  devote to the collection of the obligation. (9) An agency should utilize the ""warrant hold"" procedures  of the Comptroller of Public Accounts authorized by the Texas Government  Code, §403.055, to ensure that no treasury warrants are issued  to debtors until the debt is paid. Please see Accounting Policy Statement  28, ""Reporting of Debts and Certain Tax Delinquencies to the State,""  issued April 16, 1999 and reissued October 6, 2000 available on the  Comptroller of Public Accounts' website at www.cpa.state.tx.us. (c) Referral to attorneys. (1) Suit on the obligation by in-house attorneys. (A) Agencies seeking to use in-house attorneys to collect  delinquent obligations through court proceedings must submit a written  request to the attorney general's Bankruptcy and Collections Division.  Upon written approval, a state agency may file suit to collect a delinquent  obligation through an attorney serving as a full-time employee of  the agency. Where circumstances make it impractical to secure attorney  general approval for every delinquent obligation upon which a lawsuit  is to be filed, a state agency may apply to the attorney general for  an authorization to bring suit on particular types of obligations  through attorneys employed full-time by the agency. Such authorization,  if given, must be renewed at the beginning of each fiscal year.  (B) After an obligation is referred to agency attorneys  employed as in-house counsel, the obligation shall be reduced to judgment  against all entities legally responsible for the obligation where  the lawsuit and judgment will make collection of the obligation more  likely and the expenditure of agency resources in recovering judgment  on the obligation is justified. (C) Where authorized by law, the agency shall plead  for and recover attorney's fees, investigative costs, and court costs  in addition to the obligation. (D) Every judgment taken on a delinquent obligation  should be abstracted and recorded by the agency in every county where  the debtor: owns real property; operates an active business; is likely  to inherit real property; owns any mineral interest; or has maintained  a residence for more than one year. (2) Referral to the attorney general. (A) Agencies are encouraged to explore the exchange  of accounts with the Attorney General by computer tape or other electronic  data transfer and to discuss any variances as may be appropriate.  The agency and the Attorney General may agree upon an exchange of  certain minimum account information necessary for collection efforts  by the Attorney General. (B) Agencies may refer individual accounts to the attorney  general after the procedures set forth in subsection (b)(6) - (8)  of this section. Individual accounts referred to the attorney general  should include by the following: (i) copies of all correspondence between the agency  and the debtor; (ii) a log sheet (see subsection (b)(5) of this section)  documenting all attempted contacts with the debtor and the result  of such attempts; (iii) a record of all payments made by the debtor and,  where practicable, copies of all checks tendered as payment; (iv) any information pertaining to the debtor's residence  and his assets; and (v) copies of any permit application, security, final  orders, contracts, grants, or instrument giving rise to the obligation. (C) Delinquent accounts upon which a bond or other  security is held shall be referred to the attorney general no later  than 60 days after becoming delinquent. All such accounts where the  principal has filed for relief under federal bankruptcy laws shall  be referred immediately, since collection of the security may obviate  the need to file a claim or to appear in the bankruptcy case. (D) The attorney general may decide that a particular  obligation or class of obligations may be assigned after referral  to the appropriate division within the Office of the Attorney General. (3) Referral to collection firms or private attorneys. (A) Prior approval of attorney general. Except as provided  by §2107.003, Texas Government Code, no agency may contract with,  retain, or employ any person other than a full-time employee of the  agency to collect a delinquent obligation without prior written approval  of the attorney general. Any existing arrangements must receive the  written approval of the attorney general to be renewed or extended  in any fashion. (i) Approval of contract with private firm or attorney.  Prior to contracting with, retaining, or employing a person other  than a full-time employee of the agency to collect a delinquent obligation,  an agency must submit a proposal to the attorney general requesting  the attorney general to collect the obligation(s). Any agency contracting  with any person other than a full-time employee of the agency for  the collection of a delinquent obligation must submit the proposed  contract to the attorney general for written approval. The proposal  must disclose any fee that the agency proposes to pay the private  collection firm or attorney. The attorney general may elect to undertake  representation of the agency on the same or Cont'd..."

HHSC is the state agency responsible  for overseeing and monitoring the Medicaid managed care program. Each  managed care organization (MCO) participating in the Medicaid managed  care program must offer a network of providers that is sufficient  to meet the needs of the Medicaid population who are MCO members.  HHSC monitors MCO members' access to an adequate provider network  through reports from the MCOs and complaints received from providers  and members. Certain reporting requirements are discussed in subsection  (g) of this section. (b) MCO requirements concerning coverage for treatment  of members by out-of-network providers for non-emergency services. (1) Nursing facility services. A health care MCO must  reimburse an out-of-network nursing facility for medically necessary  services authorized by HHSC, using the reasonable reimbursement methodology  in subsection (f) of this section. Nursing facility add-on services  are considered ""other authorized services"" under paragraph (2) of  this subsection, and are authorized by STAR+PLUS MCOs. (2) Other authorized services. The MCO must allow referral  of its member(s) to an out-of-network provider, must timely issue  the proper authorization for such referral, and must timely reimburse  the out-of-network provider for authorized services provided if the  criteria in this paragraph are met. If all of the following criteria  are not met, an out-of-network provider is not entitled to Medicaid  reimbursement for non-emergency services: (A) Medicaid covered services are medically necessary  and these services are not available through an in-network provider; (B) a participating provider currently providing authorized  services to the member requests authorization for such services to  be provided to the member by an out-of-network provider; and (C) the authorized services are provided within the  time period specified in the MCO's authorization. If the services  are not provided within the required time period, a new request for  referral from the requesting provider must be submitted to the MCO  prior to the provision of services. (c) MCO requirements concerning coverage for treatment  of members by out-of-network providers for emergency services. (1) An MCO may not refuse to reimburse an out-of-network  provider for medically necessary emergency services. (2) Health care MCO requirements concerning emergency  services. (A) A health care MCO may not refuse to reimburse an  out-of-network provider for post-stabilization care services provided  as a result of the MCO's failure to authorize a timely transfer of  a member. (B) A health care MCO must allow its members to be  treated by any emergency services provider for emergency services,  and services to determine if an emergency condition exists. The health  care MCO must pay for such services. (C) A health care MCO must reimburse for transport  provided by an ambulance provider for a Medicaid recipient whose condition  meets the definition of an emergency medical condition. Facility-to-facility  transports are considered emergencies if the required treatment for  the emergency medical condition, as defined in §353.2 of this  subchapter (relating to Definitions), is not available at the first  facility and the MCO has not included payment for such transports  in the hospital reimbursement. (D) A health care MCO is prohibited from requiring  an authorization for emergency services or for services to determine  if an emergency condition exists. (3) Dental MCO requirements concerning emergency services. (A) A dental MCO must allow its members to be treated  for covered emergency services that are provided outside of a hospital  or ambulatory surgical center setting, and for covered services provided  outside of such settings to determine if an emergency condition exists.  The dental MCO must pay for such services. (B) A dental MCO is prohibited from requiring an authorization  for the services described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. (C) A dental MCO is not responsible for payment of  non-capitated emergency services and post-stabilization care provided  in a hospital or ambulatory surgical center setting, or devices for  craniofacial anomalies. A dental MCO is not responsible for hospital  and physician services, anesthesia, drugs related to treatment, and  post-stabilization care for: (i) a dislocated jaw, traumatic damage to a tooth,  and removal of a cyst; (ii) an oral abscess of tooth or gum origin; and (iii) craniofacial anomalies. (D) The services and benefits described in subparagraph  (C) of this paragraph are reimbursed: (i) by a health care MCO, if the member is enrolled  in a managed care program; or (ii) by HHSC's claims administrator, if the member  is not enrolled in a managed care program. (d) Health care MCO requirements concerning coverage  for services provided to certain members by an out-of-network ""specialty  provider"" as that term is defined in §353.7(d) of this subchapter  (relating to Coordination of Benefits with Primary Health Insurance  Coverage).  (1) A health care MCO may not refuse to reimburse an  out-of-network ""specialty provider"" enrolled as a provider in the  Texas Medicaid program for services provided to a member under the  circumstances set forth in §353.7 of this subchapter.  (2) In reimbursing a provider for the services described  in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a health care MCO must use the  reasonable reimbursement methodology in subsection (f)(2) of this  section.  (e) An MCO may be required by contract with HHSC to  allow members to obtain services from out-of-network providers in  circumstances other than those described in subsections (b) - (d)  of this section. (f) Reasonable reimbursement methodology. (1) Out-of-network nursing facilities. (A) Out-of-network nursing facilities must be reimbursed: (i) at or above ninety-five percent of the nursing  facility unit rate established by HHSC for the dates of service for  services provided inside of the MCO's service area; and (ii) at or above one hundred percent of the nursing  facility unit rate for the date of services for services provided  outside of the MCO's service area. (B) The nursing facility unit rate refers to the Medicaid  fee-for-service (FFS) daily rate for nursing facility providers as  determined by HHSC. The rate includes items such as room and board,  medical supplies and equipment, personal needs items, social services,  and over-the-counter drugs. The nursing facility unit rate also includes  professional and general liability insurance and applicable nursing  facility rate enhancements. The nursing facility unit rate excludes  nursing facility add-on services. (2) Emergency and authorized services performed by  out-of-network providers. (A) Except as provided in §353.913 of this chapter  (relating to Managed Care Organization Requirements Concerning Out-of-Network  Outpatient Pharmacy Services) or subsection (j)(2) of this section,  the MCO must reimburse an out-of-network, in-area service provider  the Medicaid FFS rate in effect on the date of service less five percent,  unless the parties agree to a different reimbursement amount. (B) Except as provided in §353.913 of this chapter,  an MCO must reimburse an out-of-network, out-of-area service provider  at 100 percent of the Medicaid FFS rate in effect on the date of service,  unless the parties agree to a different reimbursement amount, until  the MCO arranges for the timely transfer of the member, as determined  by the member's attending physician, to a provider in the MCO's network. (3) For purposes of this subsection, the Medicaid FFS  rates are defined as those rates for providers of services in the  Texas Medicaid program for which reimbursement methodologies are specified  in Chapter 355 of this title (relating to Reimbursement Rates), exclusive  of the rates and payment structures in Medicaid managed care. (g) Reporting requirements. (1) Each MCO that contracts with HHSC to provide health  care services or dental services to members in a service area must  submit quarterly information in its Out-of-Network quarterly report  to HHSC. (2) Each report submitted by an MCO must contain information  about members enrolled in each HHSC Medicaid managed care program  provided by the MCO. The report must include the following information: (A) the types of services provided by out-of-network  providers for the MCO's members; (B) the scope of services provided by out-of-network  providers to the MCO's members; (C) for a health care MCO, the total number of hospital  admissions, as well as the number of admissions that occur at each  out-of-network hospital. Each out-of-network hospital must be identified; (D) for a health care MCO, the total number of emergency  room visits, as well as the total number of emergency room visits  that occur at each out-of-network hospital. Each out-of-network hospital  must be identified; (E) total dollars for paid claims by MCOs, other than  those described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph, as  well as total dollars billed by out-of-network providers for other  services; and (F) any additional information required by HHSC. (3) HHSC determines the specific form of the report  described in this subsection and includes the report form as part  of the Medicaid managed care contract between HHSC and the MCOs. (h) Utilization. (1) Upon review of the reports described in subsection  (g) of this section that are submitted to HHSC by the MCOs, HHSC may  determine that an MCO exceeded maximum out-of-network usage standards  set by HHSC for out-of-network access to health care services and  dental services during the reporting period. (2) Out-of-network usage standards. (A) Inpatient admissions: No more than 15 percent of  a health care MCO's total hospital admissions, by service area, may  occur in out-of-network facilities. (B) Emergency room visits: No more than 20 percent  of a health care MCO's total emergency room visits, by service area,  may occur in out-of-network facilities. (C) Other services: For services that are not included  in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, no more than 20 percent  of total dollars for paid claims by the MCO for services provided  may be provided by out-of-network providers. (3) Special considerations in calculating a health  care MCO's out-of-network usage of inpatient admissions and emergency  room visits. (A) In the event that a health care MCO exceeds the  maximum out-of-network usage standard set by HHSC for inpatient admissions  or emergency room visits, HHSC may modify the calculation of that  health care MCO's out-of-network usage for that standard if: (i) the admissions or visits to a single out-of-network  facility account for 25 percent or more of the health care MCO's admissions  or visits in a reporting period; and (ii) HHSC determines that the health care MCO has made  all reasonable efforts to contract with that out-of-network facility  as a network provider without success. (B) In determining whether the health care MCO has  made all reasonable efforts to contract with the single out-of-network  facility described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, HHSC considers  at least the following information: (i) how long the health care MCO has been trying to  negotiate a contract with the out-of-network facility; (ii) the in-network payment rates the health care MCO  has offered to the out-of-network facility; (iii) the other, non-financial contractual terms the  health care MCO has offered to the out-of-network facility, particularly  those relating to prior authorization and other utilization management  policies and procedures; (iv) the health care MCO's history with respect to  claims payment timeliness, overturned claims denials, and provider  complaints; (v) the health care MCO's solvency status; and (vi) the out-of-network facility's reasons for not  contracting with the health care MCO. (C) If the conditions described in subparagraph (A)  of this paragraph are met, HHSC may modify the calculation of the  health care MCO's out-of-network usage for the relevant reporting  period and standard by excluding from the calculation the inpatient  admissions or emergency room visits to that single out-of-network  facility. (i) Provider complaints. (1) HHSC accepts provider complaints regarding reimbursement  for or overuse of out-of-network providers and conducts investigations  into any such complaints. (2) When a provider files a complaint regarding out-of-network  payment, HHSC requires the relevant MCO to submit data to support  its position on the adequacy of the payment to the provider. The data  includes a copy of the claim for services rendered and an explanation  of the amount paid and of any amounts denied. Cont'd..."

(b) The MCO is responsible for investigating possible  acts of waste, abuse, or fraud for all services, including those that  the MCO subcontracts to outside entities. (c) The plan submitted to the HHSC-OIG must include  the following information to be considered for approval.  (1) A description of the MCO's procedures for detecting  possible acts of waste, abuse, and fraud by providers. The description  must address each of the following requirements: (A) use of audits to monitor compliance and assist  in detecting and identifying Medicaid program violations and possible  waste, abuse, and fraud overpayments through data matching, analysis,  trending, and statistical activities; (B) monitoring of service patterns for providers, subcontractors,  and recipients; (C) use of a hotline or another mechanism to report  potential or suspected violations; (D) use of random payment review of claims submitted  by providers for reimbursement to detect potential waste, abuse, or  fraud; (E) use of edits or other evaluation techniques to  prevent payment for fraudulent or abusive claims; (F) use of routine validation of MCO data; and (G) verification that MCO members actually received  services that were billed. (2) A description of the MCO's procedures for investigating  possible acts of waste, abuse, and fraud by providers. The procedures  must satisfy the requirements in subparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph. (A) The MCO must conduct a preliminary investigation  within 15 working days of the identification or reporting of suspected  or potential waste, abuse, or fraud. (B) The preliminary investigation must include the  following: (i) Determining if the MCO has received any previous  reports of incidences of suspected waste, abuse, or fraud or conducted  any previous investigations of the provider in question. If so, the  investigation should include a review of all materials related to  the previous investigations, the outcome of the previous investigations,  and a determination of whether the new allegations are the same or  relate to the previous investigation. (ii) Determining if the service provider has received  any educational training from the MCO in regard to the allegation. (iii) Conducting a review of the provider's billing  pattern to determine if there are any suspicious indicators. (iv) Reviewing the provider's payment history for the  past three years, if available, to determine if there are any suspicious  indicators. (v) Reviewing the policies and procedures for the program  type in question to determine if what has been alleged is a violation. (C) If it is determined that suspicious indicators  of possible waste, abuse, or fraud exist, within 15 working days from  the conclusion of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the  MCO must select a minimum of 30 recipients or 15% of a provider's  claims related to the suspected waste, abuse, and fraud; provided,  however, that if the MCO selects 15% of the claims, the MCO must include  claims relating to at least 30 recipients. The MCO may confirm the  suspicious indicators of fraud, waste, and abuse with a review of  fewer recipients or claims, provided that the MCO submits, as part  of the MCO's referral, a written justification for the decision to  substantiate the waste, abuse, or fraud with fewer recipients or claims.  Once the MCO selects the recipients or claims for review, the MCO  must: (i) within 15 working days of the selection of the  recipients or claims for review, request medical or dental records  and encounter data; and must  (ii) review the requested medical or dental records  and encounter data within 45 working days of receipt of the records  to: (I) validate the sufficiency of service delivery data  and to assess utilization and quality of care; (II) ensure that the encounter data submitted by the  provider is accurate; and (III) evaluate if the review of other pertinent records  is necessary to determine if waste, abuse, or fraud has occurred.  If the review of additional records is necessary then conduct such  review. (3) A description of the MCO's procedures for detecting  possible acts of waste, abuse, and fraud by recipients. The description  must address the following: (A) Review of claims when waste, abuse, or fraud is  suspected or reported to determine if: (i) Treatment(s) and/or medication(s) prescribed by  more than one provider appears to be duplicative, excessive, or contraindicated;  and (ii) Recipients are using more than one provider to  obtain similar treatments and/or medications; and (iii) Providers other than the assigned Primary Care  Provider (PCP) are treating the recipient, and there is no evidence  that the recipient was treated by the assigned PCP for a similar or  related condition; and (iv) The recipient has a high volume of emergency room  visits with a non-emergent diagnosis. (B) Review of medical or dental records for the recipients  in question if claims review does not clearly determine if waste,  abuse, or fraud has occurred. (C) For a health care MCO, use of edits or other evaluation  techniques to identify possible overuse or abuse of psychotropic or  controlled medications by recipients who are allegedly treated at  least monthly by two or more physicians. A physician includes: psychiatrists,  pain management specialists, anesthesiologists, and physical medicine  and rehabilitation specialists. (4) A description of the MCO's procedures for investigating  possible acts of waste, abuse, and fraud by recipients. The procedures  must satisfy the requirements in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this  paragraph, as applicable. (A) An MCO must conduct a preliminary investigation  within 15 working days of the identification or reporting of suspected  or potential waste, abuse, or fraud. (B) For a health care MCO, a preliminary investigation  must include the following: (i) Review of acute care and emergency room claims  submitted by providers for the recipient suspected of waste, abuse,  or fraud. (ii) Analysis of pharmacy claim data submitted by providers  for the recipient suspected of waste, abuse, or fraud to determine  possible abuse of controlled or non-controlled medications. If the  MCO does not have the data necessary to conduct the pharmacy claims  review, the MCO must request the data within 15 working days of the  initial identification or reporting of the suspected or potential  waste, abuse, or fraud. (iii) Analysis of claims submitted by providers to  determine if the diagnosis is appropriate for the medications prescribed.  (5) A description of the MCO's internal procedures  for referring possible acts of waste, abuse, or fraud to the MCO's  Special Investigative Unit (SIU) and the mandatory reporting of possible  acts of waste, abuse, or fraud by providers or recipients to the HHSC-OIG.  The procedures must satisfy the requirements in subparagraphs (A)  - (E) of this paragraph. (A) Assign an officer or director the responsibility  and authority for reporting all investigations resulting in a finding  of possible acts of waste, abuse, or fraud to the OIG. An officer  could be but is not limited to a Compliance Officer, a Manager of  Government Programs, or a Regulatory Compliance Analyst. (B) Provide specific and detailed internal procedures  for officers, directors, managers, and employees to report possible  acts of waste, abuse, and fraud to the MCO's SIU. The procedures must  include but are not limited to: (i) Guidance regarding what information must be reported  to the MCO's SIU. (ii) A requirement that information must be reported  to the MCO's SIU within 24 hours of identification or reporting of  suspected waste, abuse, and fraud. (C) Provide specific and detailed internal procedures  for the SIU to report investigations resulting in a finding of waste,  abuse, or fraud to the assigned officer or director. (i) Guidance regarding what information must be reported  to the assigned officer or director. (ii) A requirement that possible acts of waste, abuse,  or fraud be reported to the assigned officer or director must occur  within 15 working days of making the determination. (D) Within 30 working days of the completion of the  SIU investigation and receiving reports of possible acts of waste,  abuse, or fraud from the SIU, the assigned officer or director must  notify and refer all possible acts of waste, abuse or fraud to the  HHSC-OIG. All reports and referrals of possible acts of waste, abuse,  and fraud, with the exception of an expedited referral, must include  the following information related to the referrals: (i) the provider's enrollment/credentialing documents;  (ii) the complete SIU investigative file on the provider,  which must include:  (I) an investigative report identifying the allegation,  statutes/regulations/rules violated or considered, and the results  of the investigation; (II) the estimated overpayment identified;  (III) a summary of interviews conducted; and  (IV) a list of all claims and associated overpayments  identified by the preliminary investigation;  (iii) a summary of all past investigations of the provider  conducted by the MCO or the MCO's SIU. Upon request, the MCO shall  provide the complete investigative files or any other information  regarding those past investigations to the HHSC-OIG investigator;  (iv) copies of HHSC program and MCO policy, contract,  and other requirements, as well as statutes/regulations/rules, alleged  to be violated for the time period in question;  (v) all education letters (including education documents)  and/or recoupment letters issued to the provider by the MCO or the  MCO's SIU at any time; (vi) all medical records;  (vii) all clinical review reports/summaries generated  by the MCO; (viii) any and all correspondence and/or communications  between the MCO, the MCO's subcontractors, and any of their employees,  contractors, or agents, and the provider related to the investigation.  This should include but not be limited to agents, servants and employees  of the MCO, regardless of whether those agents, servants and employees  are part of the SIU who investigated the provider; (ix) copies of all settlement agreements between the  MCO and its contractors and the provider; and  (x) if the referral contains fewer recipients or claims  than the minimum described in paragraph (2)(C) of this subsection,  a written justification for the decision to substantiate the waste,  abuse, or fraud with fewer recipients or claims. The justification  will be subject to review and approval by HHSC-OIG, who may require  the MCO to provide further information.  (E) An expedited referral is required when the MCO  has reason to believe that a delay may result in: (i) harm or death to patients (ii) the loss, destruction, or alteration of valuable  evidence; or (iii) a potential for significant monetary loss that  may not be recoverable; or (iv) hindrance of an investigation or criminal prosecution  of the alleged offense. (6) A description of the MCO's procedures for educating  recipients and providers and training personnel to prevent waste,  abuse, and fraud. The procedures must satisfy the requirements in  subparagraphs (A) - (H) of this paragraph. (A) On an annual basis, the MCO must ensure that waste,  abuse, and fraud training is provided to each employee and subcontractor  who is directly involved in any aspect of Medicaid.

(B) The training must be specific to the area of responsibility  for the MCO and subcontractor staff receiving the training and contain  examples of waste, abuse, or fraud in their particular area of interest. (C) The MCO must ensure that general training is provided  to all Medicaid managed care staff of the MCO and its subcontractors  who are not directly involved with the areas listed in subparagraph  (A) of this paragraph. The general training must provide information  about the definition of waste, abuse, and fraud; how to report suspected  waste, abuse, and fraud; and to whom the suspected waste, abuse, and  fraud is reported. (D) The organization must provide waste, abuse, and  fraud training to all new MCO and subcontractor staff that will be  directly involved with any aspect of Medicaid within 90 days of the  employee's employment date. (E) Provide updates to all affected areas when changes  to policy and/or procedure may affect their area(s). The updates must  be provided within 20 working days of the changes occurring. Cont'd..."

(c) Payment of Minimum Payment Amount to Qualified  Nursing Facilities.  (1) An MCO must pay a Qualified Nursing Facility at  or above the Minimum Payment Amount in two installment payments for  a Calculation Period, using the calculation methodology described  in subsection (d) of this section.  (A) The MCO must make the First Payment no later than  ten calendar days after a Qualified Nursing Facility or its agent  submits a Clean Claim for a Nursing Facility Unit Rate to the HHSC-designated  portal or the MCO's portal, whichever occurs first. The MCO will make  the First Payment for the Nursing Facility Unit Rate at or above the  prevailing rate established by HHSC for the date of service. HHSC's  website includes information concerning HHSC's prevailing rates. The  MCO must make the Second Payment no later than 10 calendar days after  being notified of the Second Payment amount by HHSC. The Second Payment  will be the difference between the Minimum Payment Amount and the  adjustment to the Minimum Payment Amount, as calculated by HHSC and  described in subsection (d) of this section.  (B) For purposes of illustration only, if a Qualified  Nursing Facility provider files a Clean Claim for a Nursing Facility  Unit Rate on March 6, 2015, the MCO must make the First Payment no  later than March 16, 2015, and the Second Payment no later than 10  calendar days after being notified of the Second Payment amount by  HHSC.  (2) HHSC will provide each MCO with a list of its Qualified  Nursing Facilities for each Calculation Period as well as the Second  Payment amount, as calculated by HHSC and described in subsection  (d) of this section, associated with the MCO's members for each of  its Qualified Nursing Facilities.  (d) Calculation of the Second Payment. HHSC will calculate  the Second Payment for each Qualified Nursing Facility using the methodology  detailed in this subsection. If a Qualified Nursing Facility is contracted  with more than one MCO, HHSC will calculate a separate Second Payment  for each MCO with which the Qualified Nursing Facility is contracted.  (1) Calculate the Minimum Payment Amount. The Minimum  Payment Amount is made up of multiple subsidiary amounts. There is  a subsidiary amount for each RUG.  (A) To determine the subsidiary amount for a particular  RUG, use the formula: Subsidiary Amount = Days of Service x Medicare  Rate, where:  (i) ""Days of Service"" is the total Medicaid days of  service for a particular RUG for clean claims for services that were  provided during the Calculation Period; and  (ii) ""Medicare Rate"" is the Medicare skilled nursing  facility payment rate for the RUG in effect on the date of service.  (B) The Minimum Payment Amount is equal to the sum  of all subsidiary amounts calculated in accordance with subparagraph  (A) of this paragraph.  (2) Calculate the Adjustment to the Minimum Payment  Amount. The adjustment to the Minimum Payment Amount is equal to the  sum of all adjustments for each RUG. The adjustment to the Minimum  Payment Amount is determined as follows:  (A) First, determine the amount of the First Payment  to the nursing facility using the formula: First Payment = Days of  Service x MCO Rate, where:  (i) ""Days of Service"" is the total Medicaid days of  service for a particular RUG for clean claims for services that were  provided during the Calculation Period; and  (ii) ""MCO Rate"" is the rate paid by the MCO for the  particular RUG.  (B) Second, sum the result in subparagraph (A) of this  paragraph for each RUG.  (C) Third, add or subtract, as necessary, the amount  of payment adjustments to Nursing Facility Unit Rate claims for services  that were provided during the Calculation Period from the result in  subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.  (D) Fourth, determine the amount related to the Nursing  Facility Add-on Services using the formula: Nursing Facility Add-on  Amount = Days of Service x Per Diem, where:  (i) ""Days of Service"" equals the number used in subparagraph  (A)(i) of this paragraph; and  (ii) ""Per Diem"" is an estimate, as determined by HHSC,  of the weighted average per diem payment amount for Nursing Facility  Add-on Services provided to Medicaid recipients in Qualified Nursing  Facilities.  (I) For Eligibility Period One, the per diem will equal  $3.48.  (II) For Eligibility Period Two, the per diem will  equal $3.48 plus medical inflation between the mid-point of Eligibility  Period One and the mid-point of Eligibility Period Two, as determined  by HHSC.  (III) For Eligibility Period Two-A, the per diem will  equal $3.48 plus medical inflation between the mid-point of Eligibility  Period One and the mid-point of Eligibility Period Two-A, as determined  by HHSC.  (IV) For Eligibility Period Three, the per diem will  equal $3.48 plus medical inflation between the mid-point of Eligibility  Period One and the mid-point of Eligibility Period Three, as determined  by HHSC.  (E) Fifth, sum the result in subparagraph (D) of this  paragraph for each RUG.  (F) Sixth, determine the adjustment to the Minimum  Payment Amount by adding the result from subparagraph (E) of this  paragraph from the result from subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.  (3) Calculate the Second Payment. To determine the  Second Payment, subtract the adjustment to the Minimum Payment Amount  described in paragraph (2)(F) of this subsection from the Minimum  Payment Amount described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.  (e) Eligibility for Receipt of Minimum Payment Amounts.  (1) A nursing facility is eligible to receive the Minimum  Payment Amounts described in this section if it complies with the  requirements described in this subsection for each Eligibility Period.  (2) Eligibility Period One. A nursing facility is eligible  to receive Minimum Payment Amounts for Eligibility Period One if it  meets the following requirements:  (A) The nursing facility must be a Non-state Government-owned  Nursing Facility with a Medicaid contract effective date of October  1, 2014, or earlier. HHSC will finalize its list of eligible facilities  on November 1, 2014. A facility may only be eligible if its contract  is assigned by DADS to a non-state government entity by October 31,  2014, with an effective date of October 1, 2014, or earlier.  (B) The Non-state Governmental Entity that owns the  nursing facility must have entered into an IGT Responsibility agreement  with HHSC by November 3, 2014. The IGT Responsibility agreement will  cover the estimated IGT Responsibility for the nursing facility for  the Eligibility Period.  (C) The Non-state Governmental Entity that owns the  nursing facility must certify the following facts on a form prescribed  by HHSC and the form must be received by HHSC by November 3, 2014.

This section establishes the Quality  Incentive Payment Program (QIPP) for nursing facilities (NFs) providing  services under Medicaid managed care on or after September 1, 2019.  QIPP is designed to incentivize NFs to improve quality and innovation  in the provision of NF services to Medicaid recipients through the  use of metrics that are expected to advance at least one of the goals  and objectives of the state's quality strategy. (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section. Terms that are used in this and  other sections of this subchapter may be defined in §353.1301  (relating to General Provisions) or §353.1304 (relating to Quality  Metrics for the Quality Incentive Payment Program for Nursing Facilities  on or after September 1, 2019) of this subchapter. (1) CHOW application--An application filed with HHSC  for a NF change of ownership (CHOW). (2) Program period--A period of time for which an eligible  and enrolled NF may receive the QIPP amounts described in this section.  Each QIPP program period is equal to a state fiscal year (FY) beginning  September 1 and ending August 31 of the following year. (3) Network nursing facility--A NF located in the state  of Texas that has a contract with a Managed Care Organization (MCO)  for the delivery of Medicaid covered benefits to the MCO's enrollees. (4) Non-state government-owned NF--A network nursing  facility where a non-state governmental entity located in the state  of Texas holds the license and is a party to the NF's Medicaid provider  enrollment agreement with the state. (5) Private NF--A network nursing facility not owned  by a governmental entity located in the state of Texas, and holds  a license. (6) Regional Healthcare Partnership (RHP)--A collaboration  of interested participants that work collectively to develop and submit  to the state a regional plan for health care delivery system reform  as defined and established under Chapter 354, Subchapter D, of this  title (relating to Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement  Program). (7) Runout Period--A period of 23 months following  the end of the program period during which the MCO may make adjustments  to the MCO member months.  (c) Eligibility for participation in QIPP. A NF is  eligible to participate in QIPP if it complies with the requirements  described in this subsection. (1) The NF is a non-state government-owned NF. (A) The non-state governmental entity that owns the  NF must certify the following facts on a form prescribed by HHSC. (i) That it is a non-state government-owned NF where  a non-state governmental entity holds the license and is party to  the facility's Medicaid contract; and (ii) That all funds transferred to HHSC via an intergovernmental  transfer (IGT) for use as the state share of payments are public funds. (B) The NF must be located in the state of Texas in  the same RHP as, or within 150 miles of, the non-state governmental  entity taking ownership of the facility, be owned by the non-state  governmental entity for no less than four years prior to the first  day of the program period, or must be able to certify in connection  with the enrollment application that they can demonstrate an active  partnership between the NF and the non-state governmental entity that  owns the NF. The following criteria demonstrate an active partnership  between the NF and the non-state governmental entity that owns the  NF. (i) Monthly meetings (in-person or virtual) with NF  administrative staff to review the NF's clinical and quality operations  and identify areas for improvement. Meetings should include patient  observations; regulatory findings; review of CASPER reports, quality  measures, grievances, staffing, risk, incidents, accidents, and infection  control measures; root cause analysis, if applicable; and design of  performance improvement plans. (ii) Quarterly joint trainings on topics and trends  in nursing home care best practices or on needed areas of improvement. (iii) Annual, on-site inspections of the NF by a non-state  governmental entity-sponsored Quality Assurance team.  (2) The NF is a private NF. The NF must have a percentage  of Medicaid NF days of service that is greater than or equal to 65  percent. For each private NF, the percentage of Medicaid NF days is  calculated by summing the NF's Medicaid NF fee-for-service and managed  care days of service, including dual-eligible demonstration days of  service, and dividing that sum by the facility's total days of service  in all licensed beds. Medicaid hospice days of service are included  in the denominator but excluded from the numerator. (A) The days of service will be annualized based on  the NF's latest cost report or accountability report but from a year  in which HHSC required the submission of cost reports. (B) HHSC will exclude any calendar days that the NF  was closed due to a natural or man-made disaster. In such cases, HHSC  will annualize the days of service based on calendar days when the  NF was open. (d) Data sources for historical units of service. Historical  units of service are used to determine an individual private NF's  QIPP eligibility status and the distribution of QIPP funds across  eligible and enrolled NFs. (1) All data sources referred to in this subsection  are subject to validation using HHSC auditing processes or procedures  as described under §355.106 of this title (relating to Basic  Objectives and Criteria for Audit and Desk Review of Cost Reports). (2) Data sources for the determination of each private  NF's QIPP eligibility status are listed in priority order below. For  each program period, the data source must be from a cost-reporting  year and must align with the NF's fiscal year. (A) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for the private NF. If no Medicaid NF cost report is available, the  data source in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph must be used. (B) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for the private NF. If  no Medicaid Direct Care Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report  is available, the data source in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph  must be used. (C) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for a prior owner of the private NF. If no Medicaid NF cost report  for a prior owner of the private NF is available, the data source  in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph must be used. (D) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for a prior owner of the  private NF. If no Medicaid Direct Care Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation  Report for a prior owner of the private NF is available, the private  NF is not eligible for participation in QIPP. (3) Data sources for determination of distribution  of QIPP funds across eligible and enrolled NFs are listed in priority  order below. For each program period, the data source must be from  a cost-reporting year and must align with the NF's fiscal year. (A) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for the NF. If the cost report covers less than a full year, reported  values are annualized to represent a full year. If no Medicaid NF  cost report is available, the data source in subparagraph (B) of this  paragraph must be used. (B) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for the NF. If the Staffing  and Compensation Report covers less than a full year, reported values  are annualized to represent a full year. If no Staffing and Compensation  Report is available, the data source in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph  must be used. (C) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for a prior owner of the NF. If the cost report covers less than a  full year, reported values are annualized to represent a full year.  If no Medicaid NF cost report for a prior owner of the NF is available,  the data source in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph must be used. (D) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for a prior owner of the  NF. If the Staffing and Compensation Report covers less than a full  year, reported values are annualized to represent a full year. (e) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all NFs participating in QIPP must do the following. (1) The NF must submit a properly completed enrollment  application, on a form prescribed by HHSC, by the due date determined  by HHSC. The enrollment period must be no less than 30 calendar days,  and the final date of the enrollment period will be at least nine  days prior to the IGT notification. (2) The entity that owns the NF must certify, on a  form prescribed by HHSC, that no part of any payment made under the  QIPP will be used to pay a contingent fee; and that the entity's agreement  with the nursing facility does not use a reimbursement methodology  containing any type of incentive, direct or indirect, for inappropriately  inflating, in any way, claims billed to Medicaid, including the NF's  receipt of QIPP funds. The certification must be received by HHSC  with the enrollment application described in paragraph (1) of this  subsection. (3) If a provider has changed ownership in the past  five years in a way that impacts eligibility for the program, the  provider must submit to HHSC, upon demand, copies of contracts it  has with third parties with respect to the transfer of ownership or  the management of the provider, and which reference the administration  of, or payment from, this program.  (4) The NF must ensure that HHSC has access to the  NF records referenced in subsection (c) of this section and the data  for the NF from one of the data sources listed in subsection (d) of  this section. Participating facilities must ensure that these records  and data are accurate and sufficiently detailed to support legal,  financial, and statistical information used to determine a NF's eligibility  during the program period. (A) The NF must maintain these records and data through  the program period and until at least 90 days following the conclusion  of the runout period.  (B) The NF will have 14 business days from the date  of a request from HHSC to submit to HHSC the records and data. (C) Failure to provide the records and data could result  in adjustments pursuant to §353.1301(k) of this subchapter. (f) Non-federal share of QIPP payments. The non-federal  share of all QIPP payments is funded through IGTs from sponsoring  non-state governmental entities. No state general revenue is available  to support QIPP. (1) HHSC will share suggested IGT responsibilities  for the program period with all QIPP eligible and enrolled non-state  government-owned NFs at least 15 days prior to the IGT declaration  of intent deadline. Suggested IGT responsibilities will be based on  the maximum dollars available under the QIPP program, plus eight percent,  for the program period as determined by HHSC; forecast STAR+PLUS NF  member months for the program period as determined by HHSC; and the  distribution of historical Medicaid days of service across non-state  government-owned NFs enrolled in QIPP for the program period. HHSC  will also share estimated maximum revenues each eligible and enrolled  NF could earn under QIPP for the program period. Estimates are based  on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities and an assumption that all  enrolled NFs will meet 100 percent of their quality metrics. The purpose  of sharing this information is to provide non-state government-owned  NFs with information they can use to determine the amount of IGT they  wish to transfer. (2) Sponsoring governmental entities will determine  the amount of IGT they wish to transfer to HHSC for the entire program  period and provide a declaration of intent to HHSC 15 business days  before the first half of the IGT amount is transferred to HHSC. (A) The declaration of intent is a form prescribed  by HHSC that includes the total amount of IGT the sponsoring governmental  entity wishes to transfer to HHSC and whether the sponsoring governmental  entity intends to accept Component One payments. (B) The declaration of intent is certified to the best  knowledge and belief of a person legally authorized to sign for the  sponsoring governmental entity but does not bind the sponsoring governmental  entity to transfer IGT. (3) Sponsoring governmental entities will transfer  the first half of the IGT amount by a date determined by HHSC. The  second half of the IGT amount will be transferred by a date determined  by HHSC. The IGT deadlines and all associated dates will be published  on the HHSC QIPP webpage by January 15 of each year. (4) Reconciliation. HHSC will reconcile the actual  amount of the non-federal funds expended under this section during  each program period with the amount of funds transferred to HHSC by  the sponsoring governmental entities for that same period using the  methodology described in §353.1301(g) of this subchapter. (g) QIPP capitation rate components. QIPP funds will  be paid to MCOs through four components of the STAR+PLUS NF managed  care per member per month (PMPM) capitation rates. The MCOs' distribution  of QIPP funds to the enrolled NFs will be based on each NF's performance  related to the quality metrics as described in §353.1304 of this  subchapter. The NF must have had at least one Medicaid client in the  care of that NF for each reporting period to be eligible for payments. (1) Component One. Cont'd..."

QIPP is designed to incentivize NFs to improve quality and innovation  in the provision of NF services to Medicaid recipients, using the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Five-Star Quality  Rating System as its measure of success.  (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section. Terms that are used in this and  other sections of this subchapter may be defined in §353.1301  of this subchapter (related to General Provisions). (1) Baseline--A NF-specific starting measure used as  a comparison against NF performance throughout the eligibility period  to determine progress in the QIPP Quality Measures.  (2) Benchmark--The CMS National Average prior to the  start of the eligibility period by which a NF's progress with the  Quality Measures is determined.  (3) CHOW application--An application filed with the  Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) for a NF change  of ownership (CHOW).  (4) DADS--The Texas Department of Aging and Disability  Services or its successor agency.  (5) Eligibility period--A period of time for which  an eligible and enrolled NF may receive the QIPP amounts described  in this section. Each QIPP eligibility period is equal to a state  fiscal year (FY) beginning September 1 and ending August 31 of the  following year. Eligibility Period One is equal to FY 2018, beginning  September 1, 2017, and ending August 31, 2018.  (6) MCO--A Medicaid managed care organization contracted  with HHSC to provide NF services to Medicaid recipients.  (7) Network nursing facility--A NF that has a contract  with an MCO for the delivery of Medicaid covered benefits to the MCO's  enrollees.  (8) Non-state government-owned NF--A network NF where  a non-state governmental entity holds the license and is a party to  the NF's Medicaid provider enrollment agreement with the state.  (9) Private NF--A NF that is not owned by a governmental  entity.  (10) Quality Assurance Performance Improvement (QAPI)  Validation Report--A monthly report submitted by a NF, that is eligible  for and enrolled in QIPP, to an MCO that demonstrates that the NF  has convened a meeting to review the NF's CMS-compliant plan for maintaining  and improving safety and quality in the NF.  (11) Regional Healthcare Partnership (RHP)--A collaboration  of interested participants that work collectively to develop and submit  to the state a regional plan for health care delivery system reform  as defined and established under Chapter 354, Subchapter D, of this  title (relating to Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement  Program).  (c) Eligibility for participation in QIPP. A NF is  eligible to participate in QIPP if it complies with the requirements  described in this subsection for each eligibility period.  (1) Eligibility Period One. A NF is eligible to participate  in QIPP for Eligibility Period One if it meets the following requirements:  (A) The NF is a non-state government-owned NF. (i) The NF must be a non-state government-owned NF  with a Medicaid contract effective date of April 1, 2017, or earlier.  A NF undergoing a CHOW from privately owned to non-state government  owned will only be eligible under this subparagraph if DADS received  a completed CHOW application by March 2, 2017, and all required documents  pertaining to the CHOW (i.e., DADS must have a complete application  for a change of ownership license as described under 40 TAC §19.201  (relating to Criteria for Licensing), §19.210 (relating to Change  of Ownership License), and §19.2308 (relating to Change of Ownership))  by March 31, 2017.  (ii) The non-state governmental entity that owns the  NF must certify the following facts on a form prescribed by HHSC.  (I) that it is a non-state government-owned NF where  a non-state governmental entity holds the license and is party to  the facility's Medicaid contract; and  (II) that all funds transferred to HHSC via an intergovernmental  transfer (IGT) for use as the state share of payments are public funds.  (iii) The NF must have been a participant in the Minimum  Payment Amounts Program (MPAP) or must be located in the same RHP  as, or within 150 miles of, the non-state governmental entity taking  ownership of the facility. This geographic proximity criterion does  not apply to NFs that can establish good cause for an exception to  this criterion.  (B) Private NFs. The NF must have a percentage of Medicaid  NF days of service that is greater than or equal to the private NF  QIPP eligibility cut-off point. The private NF QIPP eligibility cut-off  point will be equal to the mean percentage of historical Medicaid  NF days of service provided under fee-for-service (FFS) and MC by  all private NFs plus one standard deviation, as determined by HHSC.  For each private NF, the percentage of Medicaid NF days is calculated  by summing the NF's Medicaid NF FFS and MC days of service and dividing  that sum by the facility's total days of service in all licensed beds.  Medicaid hospice days of service are included in the denominator but  excluded from the numerator. (2) Future eligibility periods. Eligibility requirements  for eligibility periods after Eligibility Period One are the same  as the requirements under paragraph (1) of this subsection except  that the deadlines specified in paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection  will be updated by HHSC. Updated deadlines will be shared with all  NFs by a date to be determined by HHSC.  (d) Data sources for historical units of service. Historical  units of service are used to determine the private NF QIPP eligibility  cut-off point, individual private NF QIPP eligibility status, and  the distribution of QIPP funds across eligible and enrolled NFs.  (1) All data sources referred to in this subsection  are subject to validation using HHSC auditing processes or procedures  as described under §355.106 of this title (relating to Basic  Objectives and Criteria for Audit and Desk Review of Cost Reports).  (2) The data source for the determination of the private  NF QIPP eligibility cut-off point is the most recently available,  audited Texas Medicaid NF cost report database.  (3) Data sources for the determination of each private  NF's QIPP eligibility status are listed in priority order below. For  each eligibility period, the data source must align with the NF's  fiscal year that ends no more recently than in the calendar year four  years prior to the calendar year within which the eligibility period  ends. For example, for the eligibility period ending on August 31,  2018, the data source must align with the NF's 2014 fiscal year or  an earlier fiscal year and for the eligibility period ending on August  31, 2019, the data source must align with the NF's 2015 fiscal year  or an earlier fiscal year.  (A) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for the private NF. If no Medicaid NF cost report is available, the  data source in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph must be used.  (B) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for the private NF. If  no Medicaid Direct Care Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report  is available, the data source in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph  must be used.  (C) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for a prior owner of the private NF. If no Medicaid NF cost report  for a prior owner of the private NF is available, the data source  in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph must be used.  (D) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for a prior owner of the  private NF. If no Medicaid Direct Care Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation  Report for a prior owner of the private NF is available, the private  NF is not eligible for participation in QIPP.  (4) Data sources for determination of distribution  of QIPP funds across eligible and enrolled NFs. For each eligibility  period, the data source must align with the NF's fiscal year that  ends no more recently than in the calendar year four years prior to  the calendar year within which the eligibility period ends. For example,  for the eligibility period ending on August 31, 2018, the data source  must align with the NF's 2014 fiscal year or an earlier fiscal year  and for the eligibility period ending on August 31, 2019, the data  source must align with the NF's 2015 fiscal year or an earlier fiscal  year.  (A) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for the NF. If the cost report covers less than a full year, reported  values are annualized to represent a full year. If no audited Medicaid  NF cost report is available, the data source in subparagraph (B) of  this paragraph must be used.  (B) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for the NF. If the Staffing  and Compensation Report covers less than a full year, reported values  are annualized to represent a full year. If no Staffing and Compensation  Report is available, the data source in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph  is must be used.  (C) The most recently available Medicaid NF cost report  for a prior owner of the NF. If the cost report covers less than a  full year, reported values are annualized to represent a full year.  If no Medicaid NF cost report for a prior owner of the NF is available,  the data source in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph must be used.  (D) The most recently available Medicaid Direct Care  Staff Rate Staffing and Compensation Report for a prior owner of the  NF. If the Staffing and Compensation Report covers less than a full  year, reported values are annualized to represent a full year.  (e) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all NFs participating in QIPP must allow for the following:  (1) HHSC must be able to access data for the NF from  one of the data sources listed in subsection (d) of this section.  (2) The NF must submit a properly completed enrollment  application by the due date determined by HHSC.  (3) The entity that owns the NF must certify, on a  form prescribed by HHSC, that no part of any payment made under the  QIPP will be used to pay a contingent fee, consulting fee, or legal  fee associated with the NF's receipt of QIPP funds and the certification  must be received by HHSC with the enrollment application described  in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  (4) The entity that owns the NF must submit to HHSC,  upon demand, copies of contracts it has with third parties that reference  the administration of, or payments from, QIPP.  (f) Non-federal share of QIPP payments. The non-federal  share of all QIPP payments is funded through IGTs from sponsoring  non-state governmental entities. No state general revenue is available  to support QIPP.  (1) HHSC will share suggested IGT responsibilities  for the eligibility period with all QIPP eligible and enrolled non-state  government-owned NFs on or around May 15 of the calendar year that  also contains the first month of the eligibility period. Suggested  IGT responsibilities will be based on the maximum dollars to be available  under the QIPP program for the eligibility period as determined by  HHSC, plus ten percent; forecast STAR+PLUS NF member months for the  eligibility period as determined by HHSC; and the distribution of  historical Medicaid days of service across non-state government-owned  NFs enrolled in QIPP for the eligibility period. HHSC will also share  estimated maximum revenues each eligible and enrolled NF could earn  under QIPP for the eligibility period with those estimates based on  HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities and an assumption that all enrolled  NFs will meet 100 percent of their quality metrics. The purpose of  sharing this information is to provide non-state government-owned  NFs with information they can use to determine the amount of IGT they  wish to transfer.  (2) Sponsoring governmental entities will determine  the amount of IGT they wish to transfer to HHSC for the entire eligibility  period and will transfer one-half of that amount by May 31 of the  calendar year that also contains the first month of the eligibility  period. The second half of the IGT amount will be transferred by November  30 of the calendar year that also contains the first month of the  eligibility period.  (3) Reconciliation. HHSC will reconcile the amount  of the non-federal funds actually expended under this section during  each eligibility period with the amount of funds transferred to HHSC  by the sponsoring governmental entities for that same period using  the methodology described in §353.1301(g) of this subchapter.  (g) QIPP capitation rate components. QIPP funds will  be paid to MCOs through three new components of the STAR+PLUS NF MC  per member per month (PMPM) capitation rates. The MCOs' distribution  of QIPP funds to the enrolled NFs will be based on each NF's performance  on a set of defined quality metrics.  (1) Component One.  (A) The total value of Component One will be equal  to 110 percent of the non-federal share of the QIPP program.  (B) Interim allocation of funds across qualifying non-state  government-owned NFs will be proportional, based upon historical Medicaid  days of NF service.  (C) Monthly payments to non-state government-owned  NFs will be triggered by the NF's submission to the MCOs of a monthly  QAPI Validation Report.  Cont'd..."

This section establishes the Comprehensive  Hospital Increase Reimbursement Program (CHIRP) for program periods  on or after September 1, 2021, wherein the Health and Human Services  Commission (HHSC) directs a managed care organization (MCO) to provide  a uniform reimbursement increase to hospitals in the MCO's network  in a designated service delivery area (SDA) for the provision of inpatient  services, outpatient services, or both. This section also describes  the methodology used by HHSC to calculate and administer such reimbursement  increases. CHIRP is designed to incentivize hospitals to improve access,  quality, and innovation in the provision of hospital services to Medicaid  recipients through the use of metrics that are expected to advance  at least one of the goals and objectives of the state's managed care  quality strategy.  (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section. Terms that are used in this section  may be defined in §353.1301 of this subchapter (relating to General  Provisions).  (1) Average Commercial Reimbursement (ACR) gap--The  difference between what an average commercial payor is estimated to  pay for the services and what Medicaid actually paid for the same  services. (2) Children's hospital--A children's hospital as defined  by §355.8052 of this title (relating to Inpatient Hospital Reimbursement).  (3) Inpatient hospital services--Services ordinarily  furnished in a hospital for the care and treatment of inpatients under  the direction of a physician or dentist, or a subset of these services  identified by HHSC. Inpatient hospital services do not include skilled  nursing facility or intermediate care facility services furnished  by a hospital with swing-bed approval, or any other services that  HHSC determines should not be subject to the rate increase.  (4) Institution for mental diseases (IMD)--A hospital  that is primarily engaged in providing psychiatric diagnosis, treatment,  or care of individuals with mental illness. IMD hospitals are reimbursed  as freestanding psychiatric facilities under §355.8060 of this  title (relating to Reimbursement Methodology for Freestanding Psychiatric  Facilities).  (5) Medicare payment gap--The difference between what  Medicare is estimated to pay for the services and what Medicaid actually  paid for the same services.  (6) Outpatient hospital services--Preventive, diagnostic,  therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services that are furnished  to outpatients of a hospital under the direction of a physician or  dentist, or a subset of these services identified by HHSC. HHSC may,  in its contracts with MCOs governing rate increases under this section,  exclude from the definition of outpatient hospital services such services  as are not generally furnished by most hospitals in the state, or  such services that HHSC determines should not be subject to the rate  increase.  (7) Program period--A period of time for which HHSC  will contract with participating MCOs to pay increased capitation  rates for the purpose of provider payments under this section. Each  program period is equal to a state fiscal year beginning September  1 and ending August 31 of the following year. (8) Rural hospital--A hospital that is a rural hospital  as defined in §355.8052 of this title.  (9) State-owned non-IMD hospital--A hospital that is  owned and operated by a state university or other state agency that  is not primarily engaged in providing psychiatric diagnosis, treatment,  or care of individuals with mental disease.  (10) Urban hospital--An urban hospital as defined by §355.8052  of this title.  (c) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all hospitals participating in CHIRP must allow for the following.  (1) The hospital must submit a properly completed enrollment  application by the due date determined by HHSC. The enrollment period  must be no less than 21 calendar days and the final date of the enrollment  period will be at least nine days prior to the IGT notification.  (A) In the application, the hospital must select whether  it will participate in the optional program component described in  subsection (g)(3) of this section. A hospital cannot participate in  the program component described in subsection (g)(3) of this section  without also participating in the program component described in subsection  (g)(2) of this section.  (B) If the hospital chooses to participate in the optional  program component described in subsection (g)(3) of this section,  the hospital may be required to submit certain necessary data to calculate  the ACR gap.  (C) A hospital is required to maintain all supporting  documentation at the hospital for any information provided under subparagraph  (B) of this paragraph for a period of no less than 5 years.  (2) The entity that owns the hospital must certify,  on a form prescribed by HHSC, that no part of any payment made under  the CHIRP will be used to pay a contingent fee and that the entity's  agreement with the hospital does not use a reimbursement methodology  that contains any type of incentive, directly or indirectly, for inappropriately  inflating, in any way, claims billed to the Medicaid program, including  the hospitals' receipt of CHIRP funds. The certification must be received  by HHSC with the enrollment application described in paragraph (1)  of this subsection.  (3) If a provider has changed ownership in the past  five years in a way that impacts eligibility for this program, the  provider must submit to HHSC, upon demand, copies of contracts it  has with third parties with respect to the transfer of ownership or  the management of the provider and which reference the administration  of, or payment from, this program.  (4) All quality metrics for which a hospital is eligible  based on class, as described in subsection (d) of this section, must  be reported by the participating hospital to be eligible for payment. (d) Classes of participating hospitals.  (1) HHSC may direct the MCOs in an SDA that is participating  in the program described in this section to provide a uniform percentage  rate increase to all hospitals within one or more of the following  classes of hospital with which the MCO contracts for inpatient or  outpatient services:  (A) children's hospitals;  (B) rural hospitals;  (C) state-owned non-IMD hospitals;  (D) urban hospitals; (E) non-state-owned IMDs; and (F) state-owned IMDs.  (2) If HHSC directs rate increases to more than one  class of hospital within the SDA, the percentage rate increases directed  by HHSC may vary between classes of hospital.  (e) Eligibility. HHSC determines eligibility for rate  increases by SDA and class of hospital.  (1) Service delivery area. Only hospitals in an SDA  that includes at least one sponsoring governmental entity are eligible  for a rate increase.  (2) Class of hospital. HHSC will identify the class  or classes of hospital within each SDA described in paragraph (1)  of this subsection to be eligible for a rate increase. HHSC will consider  the following factors when identifying the class or classes of hospital  eligible for a rate increase and the percent increase applicable to  each class:  (A) whether a class of hospital contributes more or  less significantly to the goals and objectives in HHSC's managed care  quality strategy, as required in 42 C.F.R. §438.340, relative  to other classes;  (B) which class or classes of hospital the sponsoring  governmental entity wishes to support through IGTs of public funds,  as indicated on the application described in subsection (c) of this  section;  (C) the estimated Medicare gap for the class of hospitals,  based upon the upper payment limit demonstration most recently submitted  by HHSC to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS);  (D) the estimated ACR gap for the class or individual  hospitals, as indicated on the application described in subsection  (c) of this section; and  (E) the percentage of Medicaid costs incurred by the  class of hospital in providing care to Medicaid managed care clients  that are reimbursed by Medicaid MCOs prior to any rate increase administered  under this section.  (f) Services subject to rate increase.  (1) HHSC may direct the MCOs in an SDA to increase  rates for all or a subset of inpatient services, all or a subset of  outpatient services, or all or a subset of both, based on the service  or services that will best advance the goals and objectives of HHSC's  managed care quality strategy.  (2) In addition to the limitations described in paragraph  (1) of this subsection, rate increases for a state-owned IMD or non-state-owned  IMD are limited to inpatient psychiatric hospital services provided  to individuals under the age of 21 and to inpatient hospital services  provided to individuals 65 years or older.  (3) CHIRP rate increases will apply only to the in-network  managed care claims billed under a hospital's primary National Provider  Identifier (NPI) and will not be applicable to NPIs associated with  non-hospital sub-providers owned or operated by a hospital.  (g) CHIRP capitation rate components. CHIRP funds will  be paid to MCOs through two components of the managed care per member  per month (PMPM) capitation rates. The MCOs' distribution of CHRIP  funds to the enrolled hospitals may be based on each hospital's performance  related to the quality metrics as described in §353.1307 of this  subchapter (relating to Quality Metrics and Required Reporting Used  to Evaluate the Success of the Comprehensive Hospital Increase Reimbursement  Program). The hospital must have provided at least one Medicaid service  to a Medicaid client for each reporting period to be eligible for  payments.  (1) In determining the percentages described under  subsection (i)(1) and (2) of this section, HHSC will consider:  (A) information from the participants in the SDA (including  hospitals, managed-care organizations, and sponsoring governmental  entities) on the amount of IGT the sponsoring governmental entities  propose to transfer to HHSC to support the non-federal share of the  increased rates for the first six months of a program period, as indicated  on the applications described in subsection (c) of this section;  (B) the class or classes of hospital determined in  subsection (e)(2) of this section;  (C) the type of service or services determined in subsection  (f) of this section;  (D) actuarial soundness of the capitation payment needed  to support the rate increase;  (E) available budget neutrality room under any applicable  federal waiver programs;  (F) hospital market dynamics within the SDA; and (G) other HHSC goals and priorities. (2) The Uniform Hospital Rate Increase Payment (UHRIP)  is the first component.  (A) The total value of UHRIP will be equal to a percentage  of the estimated Medicare gap on a per class basis. (B) Allocation of funds across hospital classes will  be proportional to the combined Medicare gap of each hospital class  within an SDA to the total Medicare gap of all hospital classes within  the SDA.  (3) The Average Commercial Incentive Award (ACIA) is  the second component. (A) The total value of ACIA will be equal to a percentage  of the ACR gap less payments received under UHRIP.  (B) Allocation of funds across hospitals will be proportional  to each participating hospital's individual ACR gap to the total ACR  gap for all participating hospitals in the SDA. For example, if two  hospitals in a class in an SDA both have anticipated base payments  of $100 and UHRIP payments of $50, but one hospital has an estimated  ACR gap of $300 between its base payment and the estimate payment  it would have received from a commercial payor, and the other hospital  has an estimated ACR gap of $100, HHSC will first reduce the gaps  by the UHRIP payment of $50 to a gap of $250 and $50, respectively.  HHSC would then apply a uniform percentage of the gap (e.g., 50 percent  of the gap) and would calculate an ACIA payment of $125 and $25, respectively.  HHSC will then direct the MCOs to pay a percentage increase for the  first hospital of 125 percent in addition to the 50 percent increase  under UHRIP for the first hospital for a total increase of 175 percent  above the contracted base rate, and 25 percent in addition to the  50 percent increase under UHRIP for the second hospital for a total  increase of 75 percent.  (h) Distribution of CHIRP payments. CHIRP payments  will be based upon actual utilization and will be paid as a percentage  increase above the contracted rate between the MCO and the hospital.  (i) Determination of percentage of rate increase. (1) HHSC will determine the percentage of rate increase  applicable to one or more classes of hospital by program component.  (A) UHRIP rate increases will be determined by HHSC  to be the percentage that is estimated to result in payments for the  class that are equivalent to the amount described under subsection  (g)(2)(A) of this section.

This section establishes the Texas  Incentives for Physicians and Professional Services (TIPPS) program.  TIPPS is designed to incentivize physicians and certain medical professionals  to improve quality, access, and innovation in the provision of medical  services to Medicaid recipients through the use of metrics that are  expected to advance at least one of the goals and objectives of the  state's managed care quality strategy. (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section. Terms that are used in this section  may be defined in §353.1301 of this subchapter (relating to General  Provisions) or §353.1311 of this subchapter (relating to Quality  Metrics for the Texas Incentives for Physicians and Professional Services  Program). (1) Health Related Institution (HRI) physician group--A  network physician group owned or operated by an institution named  in Texas Education Code §63.002. (2) Indirect Medical Education (IME) physician group--A  network physician group contracted with, owned, or operated by a hospital  receiving either a medical education add-on or a teaching medical  education add-on as described in §355.8052 of this title (relating  to Inpatient Hospital Reimbursement) for which the hospital is assigned  or retains billing rights for the physician group. (3) Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Notification--Notice  and directions regarding how and when IGTs should be made in support  of the program.  (4) Network physician group--A physician group located  in the state of Texas that has a contract with a Managed Care Organization  (MCO) for the delivery of Medicaid covered benefits to the MCO's enrollees. (5) Other physician group--A network physician group  other than those specified under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection. (6) Program period--A period of time for which an eligible  and enrolled physician group may receive the TIPPS amounts described  in this section. Each TIPPS program period is equal to a state fiscal  year beginning September 1 and ending August 31 of the following year. (7) Total program value--The maximum amount available  under the TIPPS program for a program period, as determined by HHSC. (8) Suggested IGT responsibility--Notice of potential  amounts that a governmental entity may wish to consider transferring  in support of the program.  (c) Eligibility for participation in TIPPS. A physician  group is eligible to participate in TIPPS if it complies with the  requirements described in this subsection. (1) Physician group composition. A physician group  must indicate the eligible physicians, clinics, and other locations  to be considered for payment and quality measurement purposes in the  application process. (2) Minimum volume. Physician groups must have a minimum  denominator volume of 30 Medicaid managed care patients in at least  50 percent of the quality metrics in each Component to be eligible  to participate in the Component. (3) The physician group is: (A) an HRI physician group;  (B) an IME physician group; or (C) any other physician group that:  (i) can achieve the minimum volume as described in  paragraph (2) of this subsection;  (ii) is located in a service delivery area with at  least one sponsoring governmental entity; and (iii) served at least 250 unique Medicaid managed care  clients in the prior state fiscal year.  (d) Data sources for historical units of service and  clients served. Historical units of service are used to determine  a physician group's eligibility status and the estimated distribution  of TIPPS funds across enrolled physician groups. (1) HHSC will use encounter data and will identify  encounters based upon the billing provider's national provider identification  (NPI) number and taxonomy code combination that are billed as a professional  encounter only.  (2) HHSC will use the most recently available Medicaid  encounter data for a complete state fiscal year to determine eligibility  status of other physician groups. (3) HHSC will use the most recently available Medicaid  encounter data for a complete state fiscal year to determine distribution  of TIPPS funds across eligible and enrolled physician groups. (4) In the event of a disaster, HHSC may use data from  a different state fiscal year at HHSC's discretion.  (5) The data used to estimate eligibility and distribution  of funds will align with the data used for purposes of setting the  capitated rates for managed care organizations for the same period.  (6) HHSC will calculate the estimated rate that an  average commercial payor would have paid for the same services using  either data that HHSC obtains independently or data that is collected  from providers through the application process described in subsection  (c) of this section.  (7) If HHSC is unable to compute an actuarially sound  payment rate based on private payor information described in paragraph  (6) of this subsection for any services, then those services will  be removed from consideration from the TIPPS program.  (8) All services billed and delivered at a Federally  Qualified Health Center, dental services, and ambulance services are  excluded from the scope of the TIPPS program.  (9) Encounter data used to calculate payments for this  program must be designated as paid status. Encounters reported as  a paid status, but with zero or negative dollars as a reported paid  amount will not be included in the data used to calculate payments  for the TIPPS program.  (10) If a provider with the same Tax Identification  Number as the payor is being paid more than 200 percent of the Medicaid  reimbursement on average for the same services in a one-year period,  then a related-party-adjustment will be applied to the encounter data  for those encounters. This adjustment will apply a calculated average  payment rate from the rest of the provider pool to the related-parties  paid units of service.  (e) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all physician groups participating in TIPPS must allow for the following. (1) The physician group must submit a properly completed  enrollment application by the due date determined by HHSC. The enrollment  period will be no less than 21 calendar days, and the final date of  the enrollment period will be at least nine days prior to the release  of suggested IGT responsibilities. (2) The entity that bills on behalf of the physician  group must certify, on a form prescribed by HHSC, that no part of  any TIPPS payment will be used to pay a contingent fee nor may the  entity's agreement with the physician group use a reimbursement methodology  that contains any type of incentive, directly or indirectly, for inappropriately  inflating, in any way, claims billed to the Medicaid program, including  the physician group's receipt of TIPPS funds. The certification must  be received by HHSC with the enrollment application described in paragraph  (1) of this subsection. (3) If a provider has changed ownership in the past  five years in a way that impacts eligibility for the TIPPS program,  the provider must submit to HHSC, upon demand, copies of contracts  it has with third parties with respect to the transfer of ownership  or the management of the provider and which reference the administration  of, or payment from, the TIPPS program. (f) Non-federal share of TIPPS payments. The non-federal  share of all TIPPS payments is funded through IGTs from sponsoring  governmental entities. No state general revenue is available to support  TIPPS. (1) HHSC will communicate suggested IGT responsibilities  for the program period with all TIPPS eligible and enrolled HRI physician  groups and IME physician groups at least 10 calendar days prior to  the IGT declaration of intent deadline. Suggested IGT responsibilities  will be based on the maximum dollars available under the TIPPS program  for the program period as determined by HHSC, plus eight percent;  forecasted member months for the program period as determined by HHSC;  and the distribution of historical Medicaid utilization across HRI  physician groups and IME physician groups, plus estimated utilization  for eligible and enrolled other physician groups within the same service  delivery area, for the program period. HHSC will also communicate  estimated maximum revenues each eligible and enrolled physician group  could earn under TIPPS for the program period with those estimates  based on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities and an assumption that  all enrolled physician groups will meet 100 percent of their quality  metrics. (2) Sponsoring governmental entities will determine  the amount of IGT they intend to transfer to HHSC for the entire program  period and provide a declaration of intent to HHSC 21 business days  before the first half of the IGT amount is transferred to HHSC. (A) The declaration of intent is a form prescribed  by HHSC that includes the total amount of IGT the sponsoring governmental  entity intends to transfer to HHSC. (B) The declaration of intent is certified to the best  knowledge and belief of a person legally authorized to sign for the  sponsoring governmental entity but does not bind the sponsoring governmental  entity to transfer IGT. (3) HHSC will issue an IGT notification to specify  the date that IGT is requested to be transferred no fewer than 14  business days before IGT transfers are due. Sponsoring governmental  entities will transfer the first half of the IGT amount by a date  determined by HHSC, but no later than June 1. Sponsoring governmental  entities will transfer the second half of the IGT amount by a date  determined by HHSC, but no later than December 1. HHSC will publish  the IGT deadlines and all associated dates on its Internet website  by March 15 of each year. (4) Reconciliation. HHSC will reconcile the amount  of the non-federal funds actually expended under this section during  each program period with the amount of funds transferred to HHSC by  the sponsoring governmental entities for that same period using the  methodology described in §353.1301(g) of this subchapter. (g) TIPPS capitation rate components. TIPPS funds will  be paid to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) through three components  of the managed care per member per month (PMPM) capitation rates.  The MCOs' distribution of TIPPS funds to the enrolled physician groups  will be based on each physician group's performance related to the  quality metrics as described in §353.1311 of this subchapter.  The physician group must have provided at least one Medicaid service  to a Medicaid client in each reporting period to be eligible for payments. (1) Component One. (A) The total value of Component One will be equal  to 65 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across qualifying HRI and IME  physician groups will be proportional, based upon historical Medicaid  clients served. (C) Monthly payments to HRI and IME physician groups  will be triggered by performance requirements as described in §353.1311  of this subchapter. (D) Other physician groups are not eligible for payments  from Component One. (E) HHSC will reconcile the interim allocation of funds  across qualifying HRI and IME physician groups to the actual distribution  of Medicaid clients served across these physician groups during the  program period as captured by Medicaid MCOs contracted with HHSC for  managed care 180 days after the last day of the program period. This  reconciliation will only be performed if the weighted average (weighted  by Medicaid clients served during the program period) of the absolute  values of percentage changes between each practice group's proportion  of historical Medicaid clients served and actual Medicaid clients  served is greater than 18 percent. (2) Component Two. (A) The total value of Component Two will be equal  to 25 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across qualifying HRI and IME  physician groups will be proportional, based upon historical Medicaid  utilization. (C) Payments to physician groups will be triggered  by achievement of performance requirements as described in §353.1311  of this subchapter. (D) Other physician groups are not eligible for payments  from Component Two.  (3) Component Three. (A) The total value of Component Three will be equal  to 10 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across physician groups will  be proportional, based upon actual Medicaid utilization of specific  procedure codes as identified in the final quality metrics or performance  requirements described in §353.1311 of this subchapter. (C) Payments to physician groups will be triggered  by achievement of performance requirements as described in §353.1311  of this subchapter during the reporting period prior to the payment  period. (4) Funds that are non-disbursed due to failure of  one or more physician groups to meet performance requirements will  be distributed across all qualifying physician groups in the service  delivery area based on each physician group's proportion of total  earned TIPPS funds from Components One, Two and Three combined at  the end of the year.

This section establishes the Rural  Access to Primary and Preventive Services (RAPPS) program. RAPPS is  designed to incentivize rural health clinics (RHCs) to improve quality,  access, and innovation in the provision of medical services to Medicaid  recipients through the use of metrics that are expected to advance  at least one of the goals and objectives of the state's managed care  quality strategy. (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section. Other terms used in this section  may be defined in §353.1301 of this subchapter (relating to General  Provisions) or §353.1317 of this subchapter (relating to Quality  Metrics for the Rural Access to Primary and Preventive Services Program). (1) Freestanding rural health clinic (RHC)--A network  RHC that is not affiliated with a hospital.  (2) Hospital-based RHC--A network RHC that is affiliated  with a hospital.  (3) Intergovernmental transfer (IGT) notification--Notice  and directions regarding how and when IGTs should be made in support  of RAPPS.  (4) Network RHC--An RHC located in the state of Texas  that has a contract with a managed care organization (MCO) for the  delivery of Medicaid covered services to the MCO's enrollees. (5) Program period--A period of time for which the  Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) contracts with MCOs  to pay increased capitation rates for the purpose of making RHC payments  under this section. Each program period is equal to a state fiscal  year beginning September 1 and ending August 31 of the following year.  An RHC that is unable to participate in RAPPS beginning September  1 may apply to participate from March 1 until August 31 of the same  program period. Participation during such a modified program period  is subject to the application and intergovernmental transfer (IGT)  deadlines described in subsection (g) of this section.  (6) Rural health clinic (RHC)--Has the meaning assigned  by 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d(l)(1).  (7) Suggested IGT responsibility--Notice of potential  amounts that a sponsoring governmental entity may wish to consider  transferring in support of RAPPS.  (8) Total program value--The maximum amount available  under the RAPPS program for a program period, as determined by HHSC.  (c) Classes of RHCs. (1) HHSC may direct an MCO to provide an increased  payment or percentage rate increase for certain services to all RAPPS-enrolled  RHCs in one or more of the following classes of RHCs with which the  MCO contracts for Medicaid services:  (A) hospital-based RHCs; and  (B) freestanding RHCs.  (2) If HHSC directs rate increases or payments to more  than one RHC class in the service delivery area (SDA), the rate increases  or payments may vary by RHC class. HHSC will consider the following  factors in identifying the amount of the rate increase or payment  for each class:  (A) the RHC class's contribution to the goals and objectives  in the HHSC managed care quality strategy, as required in 42 C.F.R. §438.340,  relative to other classes; (B) the class or classes of RHC the sponsoring governmental  entity wishes to support through IGTs of public funds, as indicated  on the application described in subsection (f) of this section; and  (C) the actuarial soundness of the capitation payment  needed to support the rate increase or payment.  (d) Eligibility. An RHC is eligible to participate  in RAPPS if it meets the requirements described in this subsection. (1) Location. The RHC must be located in an SDA with  at least one sponsoring governmental entity. (2) Minimum number of Medicaid managed care encounters.  The RHC must have provided at least 30 Medicaid managed care encounters  in the prior state fiscal year. (e) Data sources for historical units of service and  clients served. Historical units of service are used to determine  an RHC's eligibility status and the estimated distribution of RAPPS  funds across enrolled RHCs. (1) HHSC will use encounter data and will identify  encounters based upon the billing provider's national provider identification  (NPI) number and provider type code. (2) HHSC will use the most recently available Medicaid  encounter data for a complete state fiscal year to determine the eligibility  status of an RHC. (3) HHSC will use the most recently available Medicaid  encounter data for a complete state fiscal year to determine the distribution  of RAPPS funds across enrolled RHCs. (4) In the event that the historical data are not deemed  appropriate for use by actuarial standards, HHSC may utilize data  from a different state fiscal year at HHSC's discretion.  (5) The data used to estimate eligibility and distribution  of funds will align with the data used for purposes of setting the  capitation rates for MCOs for the same period.  (6) To determine total program value, HHSC will calculate  the estimated rate that Medicare would have paid for the same services  using either each RHC's state fiscal year 2019 federal cost report  or last submitted cost report. For RHCs where a filed cost report  was not found, the RHC's Medicare payments will be estimated using  the SDA weighted average ratio of Medicare encounter-based reimbursements  divided by MCO reimbursement data. (7) Encounter data used to calculate RAPPS payments  must be designated as paid status with a reported paid amount greater  than zero. Encounters reported as paid status, but with a reported  paid amount of zero or negative dollars, will be excluded from the  data used to calculate RAPPS payments.  (8) If a provider with the same Tax Identification  Number as the payor is being paid more than 200 percent of the Medicaid  reimbursement on average for the same services in a one-year period,  then a related-party-adjustment will be applied to the encounter data  for those encounters. This adjustment will apply a calculated average  payment rate from the rest of the provider pool to the related-party's  paid units of service.  (f) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all RHCs participating in RAPPS, as well as any entities billing on  their behalf, must meet the following requirements. (1) The RHC must submit a properly completed enrollment  application by the due date determined by HHSC. The enrollment period  will be no less than 21 calendar days, and the final date of the enrollment  period will be at least nine calendar days prior to the release of  suggested IGT responsibilities. (2) An entity that bills on behalf of the RHC must  certify, on a form prescribed by HHSC, that no part of any RAPPS payment  will be used to pay a contingent fee and that the entity’s agreement  with the RHC does not use a reimbursement methodology that contains  any type of incentive, directly or indirectly, for inappropriately  inflating, in any way, claims billed to the Medicaid program, including  the RHC's receipt of RAPPS funds. The certification must be received  by HHSC with the enrollment application described in paragraph (1)  of this subsection. (3) If an RHC has changed ownership in the past five  years in a way that impacts eligibility for RAPPS, the RHC must submit  to HHSC, upon demand, copies of contracts it has with third parties  with respect to the transfer of ownership or the management of the  RHC and which reference the administration of, or payments from, RAPPS. (g) Non-federal share of RAPPS payments. The non-federal  share of all RAPPS payments is funded with IGTs from sponsoring governmental  entities. No state general revenue is available to support RAPPS. (1) HHSC will communicate the following information  for the program period to all RAPPS-enrolled hospital-based RHCs and  sponsoring governmental entities at least 10 calendar days prior to  the IGT declaration of intent deadline:  (A) suggested IGT responsibilities for the program  period, which will be based on:  (i) the maximum funding amount available under RAPPS  for the program period as determined by HHSC, plus ten percent; (ii) forecasted member months for the program period  as determined by HHSC; and (iii) the distribution of historical Medicaid utilization  across RHCs, plus the estimated utilization for enrolled RHCs within  the same SDA, for the program period; and (B) the estimated maximum revenues each enrolled RHC  could earn under RAPPS for the program period, which will be based  on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities and the assumption that all  enrolled RHCs will meet 100 percent of their quality metrics. (2) The estimated maximum revenues each enrolled RHC  could earn under RAPPS for the program period, which will be based  on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities and the assumption that all  enrolled RHCs will meet 100 percent of their quality metrics. (3) HHSC will issue an IGT notification to specify  the date that IGT is requested to be transferred, no fewer than 14  business days before IGT transfers are due. The IGT notification will  instruct sponsoring governmental entities as to the required IGT amounts.  Required IGT amounts will include all costs associated with RHC payments  and rate increases, including costs associated with MCO premium taxes,  risk margin, and administration, plus ten percent.  (4) Sponsoring governmental entities will transfer  the first half of the IGT amount by a date determined by HHSC, but  no later than June 1. Sponsoring governmental entities will transfer  the second half of the IGT amount by a date determined by HHSC, but  no later than December 1. HHSC will publish the IGT deadlines and  all associated dates on the HHSC website by March 15 of each year. (h) RAPPS capitation rate components. RAPPS funds will  be paid to MCOs through two components of the managed care per member  per month (PMPM) capitation rates. The MCOs' distribution of RAPPS  funds to the enrolled RHCs will be based on each RHC's performance  related to the quality metrics as described in §353.1317 of this  subchapter. The RHC must have had provided at least one Medicaid service  to a Medicaid client for each reporting period to be eligible for  payments. (1) Component One. (A) The total value of Component One will be equal  to 75 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across qualifying RHCs will  be based upon historical Medicaid utilization and RHC class. (C) Monthly payments to RHCs will be paid prospectively. (D) HHSC will reconcile the interim allocation of funds  across RAPPS-enrolled RHCs to the actual Medicaid utilization across  these RHCs during the program period as captured by Medicaid MCOs  contracted with HHSC for managed care 180 days after the last day  of the program period. This reconciliation will be performed only  if the weighted average (weighted by Medicaid utilization during the  program period) of the absolute values of percentage changes between  each RHC’s proportion of historical Medicaid utilization and  actual Medicaid utilization is greater than 10 percent.  (2) Component Two. (A) The total value of Component Two will be equal  to 25 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across qualifying RHCs will  be based upon actual Medicaid utilization of specific procedure codes  as identified in the final quality metrics and performance requirements  described in §353.1317 of this subchapter. (C) A percent increase on all applicable services will  begin when an RHC demonstrates achievement of performance requirements  as described in §353.1317 of this subchapter during the reporting  period. (i) Distribution of RAPPS payments.  (1) Prior to the beginning of the program period, HHSC  will calculate the portion of each monthly prospective payment associated  with each RAPPS-enrolled RHC broken down by RAPPS capitation rate  component, quality metric, and payment period. For example, for an  RHC, HHSC will calculate the portion of each monthly prospective payment  associated with that RHC that would be paid from the MCO to the RHC  as follows. (A) Monthly payments from Component One will be equal  to the total value of Component One for the RHC divided by twelve. (B) Payments from Component Two associated with each  quality metric will be equal to the total value of Component Two attributed  as a rate increase for specific services based upon historical utilization. (C) For purposes of the calculation described in subparagraph  (B) of this paragraph, an RHC must achieve quality metrics to be eligible  for full payment as determined by performance requirements described  in §353.1317(d) of this subchapter.  (2) An MCO will distribute payments to an enrolled  RHC based on criteria established under subsection (i) of this section. (3) Funds that are non-disbursed due to failure of  one or more RHCs to meet performance requirements will be distributed  across all qualifying RHCs in the SDA based on each RHC’s proportion  of total earned RAPPS funds from Components One and Two combined after  each payment period.

This section establishes the Directed  Payment Program for Behavioral Health Services (DPP BHS). DPP BHS  is designed to incentivize community mental health centers (CMHCs)  to improve quality, access, and innovation in the provision of medical  and behavioral health services to Medicaid recipients through the  use of metrics that are expected to advance at least one of the goals  and objectives of the state's managed care quality strategy. (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section. Terms that are used in this section  may be defined in §353.1301 of this subchapter (relating to General  Provisions) or §353.1322 of this subchapter (relating to Quality  Metrics for the Directed Payment Program for Behavioral Health Services). (1) Average Commercial Reimbursement (ACR) gap--The  difference between what an average commercial payor is estimated to  pay for the services and what Medicaid actually paid for the same  services.  (2) Certified community behavioral health clinic (CCBHC)--A  clinic certified by the state in accordance with federal criteria  and with the requirements of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act  of 2014 (PAMA).  (3) CCBHC cost-reporting gap--The difference between  what Medicaid pays for services and what the reimbursement would be  based on the CCBHC cost-reporting methodology.  (4) Community mental health center (CMHC)--An entity  that is established under Texas Health and Safety Code §534.0015  and that:  (A) Provides outpatient services, including specialized  outpatient services for children, the elderly, individuals with serious  mental illness, and residents of its mental health service area who  have been discharged from inpatient treatment at a mental health facility.  (B) Provides 24-hour-a-day emergency care services.  (C) Provides day treatment or other partial hospitalization  services, or psychosocial rehabilitation services.  (D) Provides screening for patients being considered  for admission to state mental health facilities to determine the appropriateness  of such admission.  (5) Intergovernmental transfer (IGT) notification--Notice  and directions regarding how and when IGTs should be made in support  of DPP BHS.  (6) Program period--A period of time for which the  Texas Health and Human Services (HHSC) contracts with participating  managed care organizations (MCOs) to pay increased capitation rates  for the purpose of provider payments under this section. Each program  period is equal to a state fiscal year beginning September 1 and ending  August 31 of the following year. A CMHC that is unable to participate  in the program described in this section beginning September 1 may  apply to participate beginning March 1 of the program period and ending  August 31. Participation during such a modified program period is  subject to the application and intergovernmental-transfer (IGT) deadlines  described in subsection (j) of this section.  (7) Suggested IGT responsibility--Notice of potential  amounts that a sponsoring governmental entity may wish to consider  transferring in support of DPP BHS.  (8) Total program value--The maximum amount available  under the Directed Payment Program for Behavioral Health Services  for a program period, as determined by HHSC.  (c) Classes of participating CMHCs. (1) HHSC may direct the MCOs to provide a uniform percentage  rate increase or a uniform dollar increase to all CMHCs within one  or more of the following classes of CMHCs with which the MCO contracts  for services: (A) CMHCs that are certified CCBHCs; and  (B) CMHCs that are not certified CCBHCs.  (2) If HHSC directs rate or dollar increases to more  than one class of CMHCs within the service delivery area (SDA), the  rate or dollar increases directed by HHSC may vary between classes.  (d) Data sources for historical units of service. Historical  units of service are used to determine the estimated distribution  of program funds across eligible and enrolled CMHCs. (1) HHSC will use encounter data and will identify  encounters based upon the billing provider's national provider identification  (NPI) number. (2) The most recently available Medicaid encounter  data for a complete state fiscal year will be used to determine the  distribution of program funds across eligible and enrolled CMHCs. (3) In the event that the historical data are not deemed  appropriate for use by actuarial standards, HHSC may use data from  a different state fiscal year at the discretion of the HHSC actuaries.  (4) The data used to estimate distribution of funds  will align to the extent possible with the data used for purposes  of setting the capitation rates for MCOs for the same period.  (5) HHSC will calculate the estimated rate that an  average commercial payor or Medicare would have paid for similar services  or based on the CMS approved CCBHC cost report rate methodology using  either data from Medicare cost reports or collected from providers. (6) Encounter data used to calculate DPP BHS payments  must be designated as paid status with a reported paid amount greater  than zero. Encounters reported as paid status, but with a reported  paid amount of zero or negative dollars, will be excluded from the  data used to calculate DPP BHS payments.  (e) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all CMHCs participating in the program must allow for the following. (1) The CMHC must submit a properly completed enrollment  application by the due date determined by HHSC. The enrollment period  must be no less than 21 calendar days, and the final date of the enrollment  period will be at least nine calendar days prior to the release of  suggested IGT responsibilities. (2) The entity that bills on behalf of the CMHC must  certify, on a form prescribed by HHSC, that no part of any payment  made under the program will be used to pay a contingent fee and that  the entity's agreement with the CMHC does not use a reimbursement  methodology that contains any type of incentive, directly or indirectly,  for inappropriately inflating, in any way, claims billed to the Medicaid  program, including the CMHC's receipt of program funds. The certification  must be received by HHSC with the enrollment application described  in paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3) If a provider has changed ownership in the past  five years in a way that impacts eligibility for DPP BHS, the provider  must submit to HHSC, upon demand, copies of contracts it has with  third parties with respect to the transfer of ownership or the management  of the provider and which reference the administration of, or payment  from, DPP BHS. (f) Determination of percentage of rate and dollar  increase. (1) HHSC will determine the percentage of rate or dollar  increase applicable to CMHC by program component. (2) HHSC will consider the following factors when determining  the rate increase: (A) the estimated Medicare gap for CMHCs, based upon  the upper payment limit demonstration most recently submitted by HHSC  to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS);  (B) the estimated Average Commercial Reimbursement  (ACR) gap for the class or individual CMHCs, as indicated in data  collected from CMHCs; (C) the estimated gap for CMHCs, based on the CCBHC  cost-reporting methodology that is consistent with the CMS guidelines;  (D) the percentage of Medicaid costs incurred by CMHCs  in providing care to Medicaid managed care clients that are reimbursed  by Medicaid MCOs prior to any rate increase administered under this  section; and  (E) the actuarial soundness of the capitation payment  needed to support the rate increase. (g) Services subject to rate and dollar increase. HHSC  may direct the MCOs to increase rates or dollar amounts for all or  a subset of CMHC services. (h) Program capitation rate components. Program funds  will be paid to MCOs through two components of the managed care per  member per month (PMPM) capitation rates. The MCOs' distribution of  program funds to the enrolled CMHCs will be based on each CMHC's performance  related to the quality metrics as described in §353.1322 of this  subchapter. The CMHC must have provided at least one Medicaid service  to a Medicaid client for each reporting period to be eligible for  payments. (1) Component One. (A) The total value of Component One will be equal  to 65 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across all qualifying CMHCs  will be proportional, based upon historical Medicaid utilization.  (C) Monthly payments to CMHCs will be triggered by  achievement of requirements as described in §353.1322 of this  subchapter. (D) The interim allocation of funds across qualifying  CMHCs will be reconciled to the actual Medicaid utilization across  these CMHCs during the program period, as captured by Medicaid MCOs  contracted with HHSC for managed care 180 days after the last day  of the program period. This reconciliation will only be performed  if the absolute values of percentage changes between each CMHC's proportion  of historical Medicaid utilization and actual Medicaid utilization  is greater than 10 percent.  (2) Component Two. (A) The total value of Component Two will be equal  to 35 percent of total program value. (B) Allocation of funds across all qualifying CMHCs  will be based upon historical Medicaid utilization. (C) Payments to CMHCs will be triggered by achievement  of performance requirements as described in §353.1322 of this  subchapter. (3) Non-disbursed funds. Funds that are non-disbursed  due to failure of one or more CMHCs to meet performance requirements  will be distributed across all qualifying CMHCs based on each CMHC's  proportion of total earned program funds from Components One and Two  combined at the end of the year. (i) Distribution of the Directed Payment Program for  Behavioral Health Services payments.  (1) Prior to the beginning of the program period, HHSC  will calculate the portion of each payment associated with each enrolled  CMHC broken down by program capitation rate component, quality metric,  and payment period. For example, for a CMHC, HHSC will calculate the  portion of each payment associated with that CMHC that would be paid  from the MCO to the CMHC as follows. (A) Monthly payments in the form of a uniform dollar  increase for Component One will be equal to the total value of Component  One attributed based upon historical utilization of the CMHC divided  by twelve. (B) Ongoing rate increases from Component Two will  be paid as performance requirements are met and will be a uniform  percentage rate increase on applicable services calculated based on  the total value of Component Two for the CMHCs divided by historical  utilization of the respective services. (C) For purposes of the calculation described in subparagraph  (B) of this paragraph, a CMHC must achieve a minimum number of measures  as identified in §353.1322 of this subchapter to be eligible  for full payment.  (2) MCOs will distribute payments to enrolled CMHCs  based on criteria established under paragraph (1) of this subsection. (j) Non-federal share of DPP BHS payments. The non-federal  share of all DPP BHS payments is funded through IGTs from sponsoring  governmental entities. No state general revenue that is not otherwise  available to CMHCs is available to support DPP BHS. (1) HHSC will communicate suggested IGT responsibilities  for the program period with all DPP BHS eligible and enrolled CMHCs  at least 10 calendar days prior to the IGT declaration of intent deadline.  Suggested IGT responsibilities will be based on the maximum dollars  available under DPP BHS for the program period as determined by HHSC,  plus 10 percent; forecasted member months for the program period as  determined by HHSC; and the distribution of historical Medicaid utilization  across CMHCs, for the program period. HHSC will also communicate estimated  maximum revenues each eligible and enrolled CMHC could earn under  DPP BHS for the program period with those estimates based on HHSC's  suggested IGT responsibilities and an assumption that all enrolled  CMHCs will meet 100 percent of their quality metrics. (2) Sponsoring governmental entities will determine  the amount of IGT they intend to transfer to HHSC for the entire program  period and provide a declaration of intent to HHSC 21 business days  before the first half of the IGT amount is transferred to HHSC. (A) The declaration of intent is a form prescribed  by HHSC that includes the total amount of IGT the sponsoring governmental  entity intends to transfer to HHSC. (B) The declaration of intent is certified to the best  knowledge and belief of a person legally authorized to sign for the  sponsoring governmental entity but does not bind the sponsoring governmental  entity to transfer IGT.

Claims must be received  by the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) or its designee  in accordance with the following time limits to be considered for  payment. Due to the volume of claims processed, claims that do not  comply with the following deadlines will be denied payment. (1) Inpatient hospital claims. Final inpatient hospital  claims must be received by HHSC or its designee within 95 days from  the date of discharge or 95 days from the date the Texas Provider  Identifier (TPI) Number is issued, whichever occurs later. In the  following situations, hospitals may, and in one instance, must file  interim claims: (A) Hospitals reimbursed according to prospective payment  may submit an interim claim after the patient has been in the facility  30 consecutive days or longer.  (B) Children's hospitals reimbursed according to Tax  Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) methodology may  submit interim claims prior to discharge and must submit an interim  claim if the patient remains in the hospital past the hospital's fiscal  year end. (2) Outpatient hospital claims must be received by  HHSC or its designee within 95 days from each date of service on the  claim or 95 days from the date the Texas Provider Identifier (TPI)  Number is issued, whichever occurs later. (3) Claims from all other providers delivering services  reimbursed by the Texas Medicaid acute care program must be received  by HHSC or its designee within 95 days from each date of service on  the claim or 95 days from the date the Texas Provider Identifier (TPI)  Number is issued, whichever occurs later. This requirement does not  apply to providers who deliver long-term care services and are subject  to the billing requirements under Title 40 of the Texas Administrative  Code. (4) Providers must adhere to claims filing and appeal  deadlines and all claims must be finalized within 24 months of the  date of service. Submitted claims that exceed this time frame and  do not qualify for one of the exceptions listed in subsection (g)  of this section will not be considered for payment by the Texas Medicaid  program. (5) The following exceptions to the claims-filing deadlines  listed in this subsection apply to all claims received by HHSC or  its designee regardless of provider or service type. (A) Claims on behalf of an individual who has applied  for Medicaid coverage but has not been assigned a Medicaid recipient  number on the date of service must be received by HHSC or its designee  within 95 days from the date the Medicaid eligibility is added to  HHSC's eligibility file. This date is referred to as the ""add date."" (B) If a client loses Medicaid eligibility and is later  determined to be eligible, or if the Medicaid eligibility is established  retroactively, the claim must be received by HHSC or its designee  within 95 days from the ""add date"" and within 365 days from the date  of service. (C) When a service is a benefit of Medicare and Medicaid,  and the client is covered by both programs (dually eligible), the  claim must first be filed with Medicare. Claims processed by Medicare  must be received by HHSC or its designee within 95 days from the date  of Medicare disposition or final determination of any Medicare appeal  decision. (D) When a client is eligible for Medicare Part B only,  the inpatient hospital claim for services covered as Medicaid only  should be submitted directly to Medicaid. The time limits in paragraph  (1) of this subsection apply. (E) When a service is billed to another insurance resource,  the claim must be received by HHSC or its designee within 95 days  from the date of disposition by the other insurance resource. (F) When a service is billed to a third party resource  that has not responded, the claim must be received by HHSC or its  designee within 365 days from the date of service. However, 110 days  must elapse after the third party billing before submitting the claim  to HHSC or its designee. (G) When a Title XIX family planning service is denied  by Title XX prior to being submitted to Medicaid, the claim must be  received by HHSC or its designee within 95 days of the date on the  Title XX Denial Remittance Advice. (H) Claims for services rendered by out-of-state providers  must be received by HHSC or its designee within 365 days from the  date of service. (I) Claims for services rendered by the County Indigent  Health Care Program, for which certification of the expenditures of  local or state funds is required, are due to HHSC or its designee  within the 365-day federal filing deadline. (J) Claims for services rendered by school districts  under the School Health and Related Services (SHARS) program, for  which certification of the expenditures of local or state funds is  required, are due to HHSC or its designee within the 365-day federal  filing deadline or 95 days after the last day of the Federal Fiscal  Year (FFY), whichever comes first. (K) Claims for services rendered by enrolled Medicaid  providers under the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services'  Blind Children's Vocational Discovery and Development Program (BCVDDP),  for which certification of the expenditures of local or state funds  is required, are due to HHSC or its designee within 365 days from  the date of service. (b) Appeals. All appeals of claims and requests for  adjustments must be received by HHSC or its designee within 120 days  from the date of the last denial of and/or adjustment to the original  claim. Appeals must comply with §354.2217 of this chapter (relating  to Provider Appeals and Reviews). (c) Incomplete Claims. Claims received by HHSC or its  designee that are lacking the information necessary for processing  will be denied as incomplete claims. The resubmission of the claim  containing the necessary information must be received by HHSC or its  designee within 120 days from the last denial date. (d) Extension. If a filing deadline falls on a weekend  or holiday, the filing deadline shall be extended to the next business  day following the weekend or holiday. (e) Additional Exceptions to the 95-day Claim Filing  Deadline. (1) HHSC shall consider the following additional exceptions  when at least one of the situations included in this subsection exists.  The final decision of whether a claim falls within one of the exceptions  will be made by HHSC. (A) Catastrophic event that substantially interferes  with normal business operations of the provider, or damage or destruction  of the provider's business office or records by a natural disaster,  including but not limited to fire, flood, or earthquake; or damage  or destruction of the provider's business office or records by circumstances  that are clearly beyond the control of the provider, including but  not limited to criminal activity. The damage or destruction of business  records or criminal activity exception does not apply to any negligent  or intentional act of an employee or agent of the provider because  these persons are presumed to be within the control of the provider.  The presumption can only be rebutted when the intentional acts of  the employee or agent leads to termination of employment and filing  of criminal charges against the employee or agent; or (B) Delay or error in the eligibility determination  of a recipient, or delay due to erroneous written information from  HHSC or its designee, or another state agency; or (C) Delay due to electronic claim or system implementation  problems experienced by HHSC and its designee or providers; or (D) Submission of claims occurred within the 365-day  federal filing deadline, but the claim was not filed within 95-days  from the date of service because the service was determined to be  a benefit of the Medicaid program and an effective date for the new  benefit was applied retroactively; or (E) Recipient eligibility is determined retroactively  and the provider is not notified of retroactive coverage. (2) Under the conditions and circumstances included  in paragraph (1) of this subsection, providers must submit the following  documentation, if appropriate, and any additional requested information  to substantiate approval of an exception. All claims that are to be  considered for an exception must accompany the request. HHSC will  consider only the claims that are attached to the request. (A) All exception requests. The provider must submit  an affidavit or statement from the provider stating the details of  the cause for the delay, the exception being requested, and verification  that the delay was not caused by neglect, indifference, or lack of  diligence of the provider or the provider's employee or agent. This  affidavit or statement must be made by the person with personal knowledge  of the facts. (B) Exception requests within paragraph (1)(A) of this  subsection. The provider must submit independent evidence of insurable  loss; medical, accident, or death records; or police or fire report  substantiating the exception of damage, destruction, or criminal activity. (C) Exception requests within paragraph (1)(B) of this  subsection. The provider must submit the written document from HHSC,  or its designee, that contains the erroneous information or explanation  of the delayed information. (D) Exception requests within paragraph (1)(C) of this  subsection. (i) The provider must submit the written repair statement,  invoice, computer or modem generated error report (indicating attempts  to transmit the data failed for reasons outside the control of the  provider), or the explanation for the system implementation problems.  The documentation must include a detailed explanation made by the  person making the repairs or installing the system, specifically indicating  the relationship and impact of the computer problem or system implementation  to claims submission, and a detailed statement explaining why alternative  billing procedures were not initiated after the delay in repairs or  system implementation was known. (ii) If the provider is requesting an exception based  upon an electronic claim or system implementation problem experienced  by HHSC or its designee, the provider must submit a written statement  outlining the details of the electronic claim or system implementation  problems experienced by HHSC or its designee that caused the delay  in the submission of claims by the provider, any steps taken to notify  the state or its designee of the problem, and a verification that  the delay was not caused by the neglect, indifference, or lack of  diligence on the part of the provider or its employees or agents. (E) Exception requests within paragraph (1)(D) of this  subsection. The provider must submit a written, detailed explanation  of the facts and documentation to demonstrate the 365-day federal  filing deadline for the benefit was met. (F) Exception requests within paragraph (1)(E) of this  subsection. The provider must submit a written, detailed explanation  of the facts and activities illustrating the provider's efforts in  requesting eligibility information for the recipient. The explanation  must contain dates, contact information, and any responses from the  recipient. (f) Exceptions to the 120-day appeal deadline. HHSC  shall consider exceptions to the 120-day appeal deadline if the criteria  listed in this subsection is met and there is evidence to support  paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection. The final decision about  whether a claim falls within one of the exceptions will be made by  HHSC. This is a one-time exception request; therefore, all claims  that are to be considered within the request for an exception must  accompany the request. Claims submitted after HHSC's determination  has been made for the exception will be denied consideration because  they were not included in the original request. An exception request  must be received by HHSC within 18 months from the date of service  in order to be considered. This requirement will be waived for the  exceptions listed in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection and  subsection (g) of this section. (1) Errors made by a third party payor that were outside  the control of the provider. The provider must submit a statement  outlining the details of the cause for the error, the exception being  requested, and verification that the error was not caused by neglect,  indifference, or lack of diligence on the part of the provider, the  provider's employee, or agent. This affidavit or statement should  be made by the person with personal knowledge of the facts. In lieu  of the above affidavit or statement from the provider, the provider  may obtain an affidavit or statement from the third party payor including  the same information, and provide this to HHSC as part of the request  for appeal. (2) Errors made by the reimbursement entity that were  outside the control of the provider. The provider must submit a statement  from the original payor outlining the details of the cause of the  error, the exception being requested, and verification that the error  was not caused by neglect, indifference, or lack of diligence on the  part of the provider, the provider's employee or agent. In lieu of  the above reimbursement entity's statement, the provider may submit  a statement including the same information, and provide this to HHSC  as part of the request for appeal. Cont'd..."

The home health agency is  responsible for obtaining prior authorization where specified for  the healthcare service, supply, equipment, or appliance. Home health  service benefits include the following:  (1) Skilled nursing. Nursing services provided by a  registered nurse (RN) or licensed vocational nurse (LVN) licensed  by the Texas Board of Nursing provided on a part-time or intermittent  basis and furnished through an enrolled home health agency are covered  benefits. Billable nursing visits may also include:  (A) nursing visits required to teach the recipient,  the primary caregiver, a family member and/or neighbor how to administer  or assist in a service or activity that is necessary to the care and/or  treatment of the recipient in a home setting;  (B) RN visits for skilled nursing observation, assessment,  and evaluation, provided a physician specifically requests that a  nurse visit the recipient for this purpose.  (i) The physician's request must reflect the need for  the assessment visit.  (ii) Nursing visits for the primary purpose of assessing  a recipient's care needs to develop a plan of care are considered  administrative and are not billable; and  (C) RN visits for general supervision of nursing care  provided by a home health aide and/or others over whom the RN is administratively  or professionally responsible.  (2) Home health aide services. Home health aide services  to provide personal care under the supervision of an RN, a licensed  physical therapist (PT), or an occupational therapist (OT) employed  by the home health agency are covered benefits.  (A) The primary purpose of a home health aide visit  must be to provide personal care services.  (B) Duties of a home health aide include the performance  of simple procedures such as personal care, ambulation, exercise,  range of motion, safe transfer, positioning, and household services  essential to health care at home; assistance with medications that  are ordinarily self-administered; reporting changes in the patient's  condition and needs; and completing appropriate records.  (C) Written instructions for home health aide services  must be prepared by an RN or therapist as appropriate.  (D) The requirements for home health aide supervision  are as follows.  (i) When only home health aide services are being furnished  to a recipient, an RN must make a supervisory visit to the recipient's  residence at least once every 60 days. These supervisory visits must  occur when the aide is furnishing patient care.  (ii) When skilled nursing care, PT, or OT are also  being furnished to a recipient, an RN must make a supervisory visit  to the recipient's residence at least every two weeks.  (iii) When only PT or OT is furnished in addition to  the home health aide services, the appropriate skilled therapist may  make the supervisory visits in place of an RN.  (E) Visits made primarily for performing housekeeping  services are not covered services.  (3) Medical supplies. Medical supplies are covered  benefits if they meet the following criteria.  (A) Medical supplies must be:  (i) documented in the recipient's plan of care as medically  necessary and used for medical or therapeutic purposes;  (ii) supplied:  (I) through an enrolled home health agency in compliance  with the recipient's plan of care; or (II) by an enrolled medical supplier under written,  signed, and dated physician's prescription; and (iii) prior authorized unless otherwise specified by  HHSC. (B) Items which are not listed in subparagraph (C)  of this paragraph may be medically necessary for the treatment or  therapy of qualified recipients. If a prior authorization request  is received for these items, consideration will be given to the request.  Approval for reasonable amounts of the requested items may be given  if circumstances justify the exception and the need is documented.  (C) Covered items include:  (i) colostomy and ileostomy care supplies;  (ii) urinary catheters, appliances and related supplies;  (iii) pressure pads including elbow and heel protectors;  (iv) incontinent supplies to include incontinent pads  or diapers for clients over the age of four for medical necessity  as determined by the physician;  (v) crutch and cane tips;  (vi) irrigation sets;  (vii) supports and abdominal binders (not to include  braces, orthotics, or prosthetics);  (viii) medicine chest supplies not requiring a prescription  (not to include vitamins or personal care items such as soap or shampoos);  (ix) syringes, needles, IV tubing and/or IV administration  setups including IV solutions generally used for hydration or prescriptive  additives;  (x) dressing supplies;  (xi) thermometers;  (xii) suction catheters;  (xiii) oxygen and related respiratory care supplies;  or  (xiv) feeding related supplies.  (4) Durable medical equipment (DME). Durable Medical  Equipment must meet the following requirements to qualify for reimbursement  under Medicaid home health services.  (A) DME must:  (i) be medically necessary and the appropriateness  of the health care service, supply, equipment, or appliance prescribed  by the physician for the treatment of the individual recipient and  delivered in his place of residence must be documented in the plan  of care and/or the request form; (ii) be prior authorized unless otherwise specified  by HHSC; (iii) meet the recipient's existing medical and treatment  needs; (iv) be considered safe for use in the home; and  (v) be provided through an:  (I) enrolled home health agency under a current physician's  plan of care; or (II) enrolled DME supplier under a written, signed,  and dated physician's prescription. (B) HHSC will determine whether DME will be rented,  purchased, or repaired based upon the duration and use needs of the  recipient. (i) Periodic rental payments are made only for the  lesser of:  (I) the period of time the equipment is medically necessary;  or  (II) when the total monthly rental payments equal the  reasonable purchase cost for the equipment.  (ii) Purchase is justified when the estimated duration  of need multiplied by the rental payments would exceed the reasonable  purchase cost of the equipment or it is otherwise more practical to  purchase the equipment.  (iii) Repair of durable medical equipment and appliances  will be considered based on the age of the item and the cost to repair  the item.  (I) A request for repair of durable medical equipment  or appliances must include an itemized estimated cost list of the  repairs.

(D) Medical equipment or appliances not listed in subparagraph  (C) of this paragraph may, in exceptional circumstances, be considered  for payment when it can be medically substantiated as a part of the  treatment plan that such service would serve a specific medical purpose  on an individual case basis.  (5) Physical therapy. To be payable as a home health  benefit, physical therapy services must:  (A) be provided by a physical therapist who is currently  licensed by the Texas Board of Physical Therapy Examiners, or physical  therapist assistant who is licensed by the Texas Board of Physical  Therapy Examiners who assists and is supervised by a licensed physical  therapist;  (B) be for the treatment of an acute musculoskeletal  or neuromuscular condition or an acute exacerbation of a chronic musculoskeletal  or neuromuscular condition;  (C) be expected to improve the patient's condition  in a reasonable and generally predictable period of time, based on  the physician's assessment of the patient's restorative potential  after any needed consultation with the therapist; and  (D) not be provided when the patient has reached the  maximum level of improvement. Repetitive services designed to maintain  function once the maximum level of improvement has been reached are  not a benefit. Services related to activities for the general good  and welfare of patients such as general exercises to promote overall  fitness and flexibility and activities to provide diversion or general  motivation are not reimbursable.  (6) Occupational therapy. To be payable as a home health  benefit, occupational therapy services must be:  (A) provided by one who is currently registered and  licensed by the Texas Board of Occupational Therapy Examiners or by  an occupational therapist assistant who is licensed to assist in the  practice of occupational therapy and is supervised by an occupational  therapist;  (B) for the evaluation and function-oriented treatment  of individuals whose ability to function in life roles is impaired  by recent or current physical illness, injury or condition; and  (C) specific goal directed activities to achieve a  functional level of mobility and communication and to prevent further  dysfunction within a reasonable length of time based on the therapist's  evaluation and physician's assessment and plan of care.

(2) Performers with a total value less than $250,000  for DY5 may increase their total value to up to $250,000 per each  subsequent DY beginning in DY6A. The increase in value is contingent  on funds availability as described in §354.1673 of this division  (relating to Remaining DSRIP Funds). Categories 1-4 will each be increased  proportionately. However, any funds in excess of the 10 percent maximum  for Category 4 will be allocated to Category 3. A performer may need  to increase a DSRIP project’s MLIU QPI goal for DY6A and beyond  in order to obtain the increased value. Performers eligible for this  option must make this choice by a date to be determined by HHSC.  (b) The DY5 IGT process, payment calculations, and  monitoring IGT are continued in the extension period. IGT entities  from DY5 will continue to provide funding for the extension period  unless a performer submits changes during the reporting period. No  new certifications (RHP Plan Section VI) are required for continuing  RHP participants.  (c) If a performer participated in Category 4 in DY5,  the performer will continue to participate in Category 4 in DY6A.  The performer's Category 4 value for DY6A will be equal to the performer's  Category 4 value for DY5, unless the performer's DY5 Category 4 value  is greater than 10 percent of the performer's total DY5 value. In  such a situation, the performer's DY6A Category 4 value will be reduced  to 10 percent of the performer's total DY5 value, and the funds above  the 10 percent threshold will be allocated to Category 3 in DY6A.  (d) The following Category 1 and 2 requirements must  be met in DY6A:  (1) Each DSRIP project must have the following four  milestones:  (A) a total Quantifiable Patient Impact (QPI) milestone  valued at 25 percent of each DSRIP project's Category 1 or 2 value;  (B) a Medicaid and Low-income or Uninsured (MLIU) QPI  milestone valued at 25 percent of each DSRIP project's Category 1  or 2 value;  (C) a core component reporting milestone valued at  25 percent of each DSRIP project’s Category 1 or 2 value; and  (D) a sustainability planning milestone valued at 25  percent of each DSRIP project’s Category 1 or 2 value. (2) Total Quantitative Patient Impact (QPI) Milestone.  (A) HHSC will convert each total QPI metric to a total  QPI milestone with standardized language. However, if a DSRIP project  has multiple QPI metrics in DY5, that project may be exempted from  this conversion, based on criteria determined by HHSC and CMS.  (B) The total QPI goal is equal to the DY5 total QPI  goal. (i) Certain DSRIP projects are eligible for an adjustment  to the total QPI goal. These DSRIP projects include projects for which  the provider reported 66 percent achievement or less of their DY4  total QPI metric as of April DY5 reporting, and for which:  (I) the value per MLIU individual is less than or equal  to $1,000; or  (II) the value per MLIU encounter is less than or equal  to $500. (ii) Performers of a DSRIP project described in clause  (i) of this subparagraph may, by a date determined by HHSC in a form  determined by HHSC, request an adjustment to the DSRIP project's total  QPI goal.  (C) DSRIP projects must retain the same QPI grouping  from the initial demonstration period for total QPI.  (D) DSRIP projects must retain the same pre-DSRIP baseline  for total QPI from the initial demonstration period. If multiple metrics  are combined to form one total QPI milestone, the pre-DSRIP baselines  will also be combined.  (E) DSRIP projects may carry forward total QPI milestones  from DY6A to DY6B and DY7.  (3) MLIU QPI Milestone.  (A) Beginning in DY6A, there is an MLIU QPI milestone.  (B) For DSRIP projects that have an MLIU QPI requirement  in DY5:  (i) The MLIU QPI goal is equal to the DY5 MLIU QPI  goal. If, based on a determination pursuant to paragraph (2)(B) of  this subsection, the total QPI goal is changed, the MLIU QPI goal  will also be changed in proportion to the total QPI goal.  (ii) If the DSRIP project has an MLIU QPI metric in  DY5, it retains the same pre-DSRIP baseline for MLIU QPI used in the  initial demonstration period. (iii) If the DSRIP project does not have an MLIU QPI  metric in DY5, the pre-DSRIP baseline for MLIU QPI is equal to the  pre-DSRIP baseline for total QPI multiplied by the earliest MLIU percentage  goal on record with HHSC.  (iv) The MLIU QPI milestone must be pay-for-performance  (P4P). (C) For DSRIP projects that do not have an MLIU QPI  requirement in DY5:  (i) The MLIU QPI goal is equal to the DY5 MLIU percentage  goal multiplied by the DY5 total QPI goal, or as indicated in the  DY5 goal language. If, based on a determination pursuant to paragraph  (2)(B) of this subsection, the total QPI goal is changed, the MLIU  QPI goal will also be changed in proportion to the total QPI goal.  (ii) The pre-DSRIP baseline for MLIU QPI is equal to  the pre-DSRIP baseline for total QPI multiplied by the earliest MLIU  percentage goal on record with HHSC.  (iii) Although all DSRIP projects must include an MLIU  QPI goal, DSRIP projects under this subparagraph, with the exception  of projects subject to clause (iv) of this subparagraph, must include  an MLIU QPI milestone that is pay-for-reporting (P4R). This means  that the performer is eligible to receive payment for the project’s  MLIU QPI milestone by reporting their actual MLIU QPI achievement,  regardless of whether the performer achieved the MLIU QPI goal.  (iv) HHSC may determine that some of these DSRIP projects  must include an MLIU QPI milestone that is P4P, meaning that the performer  must demonstrate achievement of the project’s MLIU QPI goal  in order to receive payment for the MLIU QPI milestone. (I) These DSRIP projects include the following:  (-a-) all Project Area 1.9 DSRIP projects, as described  by the RHP Planning Protocol; (-b-) DSRIP projects that did not achieve the estimated  MLIU percentage in DY3, DY4, or DY5, and that caused them to have  a higher than expected value per MLIU individual/ encounter;  (-c-) DSRIP projects for which HHSC notified the performer  that the project was eligible to continue with changes, but the project’s  MLIU QPI milestone must be P4P; and  (-d-) DSRIP projects that included an MLIU goal in  their QPI metric Baseline/Goal statement (an embedded goal) of the  performer's own choosing or that were required to include MLIU to  receive CMS initial DSRIP project approval.  (II) A performer of a DSRIP project with an MLIU QPI  milestone that is P4P under this section may request to adjust the  pre-DSRIP baseline for MLIU QPI by a date determined by HHSC in a  form determined by HHSC. HHSC will consider requests to adjust the  pre-DSRIP baseline for MLIU QPI and may approve those requests with  a strong justification.  (D) Certain DSRIP projects are eligible for an adjustment  to the MLIU QPI goal. These DSRIP projects include:  (i) a DSRIP project that HHSC identifies as underperforming  on MLIU QPI estimates in the initial demonstration period; (ii) a DSRIP project that is reporting on individuals  or encounters that meet the MLIU definition for the initial demonstration  period, but will not meet the MLIU definition for the extension period;  and  (iii) any other DSRIP project that HHSC determines  has a strong justification for an adjustment.  (E) Performers of a DSRIP project described in subparagraph  (D) of this paragraph may, by a date to be determined by HHSC, request  an adjustment to the DSRIP project's MLIU QPI goal.  (F) DSRIP projects must retain the same total QPI grouping  from the initial demonstration period for MLIU QPI.  (G) DSRIP projects may carry forward MLIU QPI milestones  from DY6A to DY6B and DY7.  (H) If a DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone is  P4R, the performer is eligible to report on, and receive payment for,  the DY6A MLIU QPI milestone once the performer has done the following:  (i) achieved or forfeited a DSRIP project's DY5 QPI  metric; and  (ii) provided at least one encounter or served at least  one individual toward the DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone  goal.  (I) If a DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone is  P4P, and the project does not have a DY5 MLIU-specific QPI metric,  the performer is eligible to report on, and receive payment for, the  DY6A MLIU QPI milestone once the performer has done the following:  (i) achieved or forfeited a DSRIP project's DY5 QPI  metric; and  (ii) achieved the DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone  goal.  (J) If a DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone is  P4P, and the project has a DY5 MLIU-specific QPI metric, the performer  is eligible to report on, and receive payment for, the DY6A MLIU QPI  milestone once the performer has done the following:  (i) achieved or forfeited the DSRIP project's DY5 MLIU-specific  QPI metric; and  (ii) achieved the DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone  goal.  (K) A performer may only begin to count individuals  served or encounters provided toward a DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI  milestone goal after the performer has achieved or forfeited a DY5  QPI metric or a DY5 MLIU-specific QPI metric.  (L) A performer is only eligible to report on, and  receive payment for, a DSRIP project's DY6A MLIU QPI milestone during  DY6A or the DY6A carry forward period.  (4) Non-QPI Milestones.  (A) DSRIP projects must include the following non-QPI  milestones:  (i) project summary and core components, which may  include continuous quality improvement (CQI); and  (ii) sustainability planning, which may include activities  toward furthering the exchange of health information, integration  into managed care, collaboration with other community partners, or  a project level-evaluation.  (B) Performers must attend at least one learning collaborative,  stakeholder forum, or other stakeholder meeting during DY6A and report  on their activities for these milestones in order to be eligible for  milestone payment.  (C) DSRIP projects may report on DY6A non-QPI milestones  only during the second reporting period of DY6A.  (D) DSRIP projects may not carry forward non-QPI milestones  from DY6A to DY6B or DY7.  (e) The following Category 3 requirements must be met  in DY6A:  (1) The Category 3 outcome values are equal to the  Category 3 outcome values for DY5. However, if a performer's Category  4 value is greater than 10 percent of the performer's total value,  the Category 4 funds in excess of the 10 percent will be redistributed  to the performer's Category 3 outcomes proportionately.  (2) If a Category 3 outcome has multiple parts, the  Category 3 outcome's value is equally divided among the parts.  (3) Each Category 3 outcome is designated as pay-for-performance  (P4P), pay-for-reporting (P4R), or maintenance. The direction of an  outcome (positive or negative) necessary to demonstrate improvement  is described in the Category 3 Compendium. An outcome designated as  maintenance was high performing at baseline with no reasonable room  for improvement and was approved to use a milestone structure for  DYs 3-5 that includes an alternate improvement activity.  (4) If a Category 3 outcome is designated as pay-for-performance  (P4P) in DY5, 100 percent of the Category 3 outcome's value is P4P.  (5) If a Category 3 outcome is designated as pay-for-reporting  (P4R) or maintenance with a population focused priority measure (PFPM)  in DY5, 100 percent of the Category 3 outcome's value is P4P of the  PFPM. (6) If a Category 3 outcome is designated as P4R with  an associated stretch activity in DY5, the performer must choose one  of the following options by a date determined by HHSC in a form determined  by HHSC:  (A) Maintain the Category 3 outcome designated as P4R  from DY5 and select a new stretch activity that does not duplicate  the DY5 stretch activity.  (i) The performer must select a new stretch activity  from the following:  (I) program evaluation (alternate approaches to program  and outcome linkages);  (II) new participation in health information exchange  (HIE) or improvement of existing HIE infrastructure; or  (III) cost analysis and value-based purchasing planning.  (ii) Under this option, 50 percent of the Category  3 outcome's value is P4R of the Category 3 outcome and 50 percent  is for completion of the stretch activity.  Cont'd..."

(1) Measure Bundle and measure selection.  (A) A hospital or physician practice, with the exception  of those described in subparagraph (J) of this paragraph, must select  Measure Bundles from the Hospital and Physician Practice Measure Bundle  Menu of the Measure Bundle Protocol in accordance with the requirements  in subparagraphs (B) - (I) of this paragraph in the RHP plan update  for its RHP. (B) Each Measure Bundle is assigned a point value as  described in the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (C) A hospital or physician practice is assigned a  minimum point threshold (MPT) for Measure Bundle selection as described  in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subsection.  (D) A hospital or physician practice must select Measure  Bundles worth enough points to meet its MPT in order to maintain its  total valuation for DY7 and DY8. If a hospital or physician practice  does not select Measure Bundles worth enough points to meet its MPT,  its total DY7 valuation will be reduced proportionately across its  RHP Plan Update and Categories B-D funds for DY7, and its total DY8  valuation will be reduced proportionately across its Categories B-D  funds for DY8, based on the point values of the Measure Bundles it  selects. (E) A hospital or physician practice may only select  a Measure Bundle for which its denominators for the baseline measurement  period for at least half of the required measures in the Measure Bundle  have significant volume.  (F) A hospital or physician practice with a valuation  greater than $2,500,000 per demonstration year (DY) for DY7-8 must:  (i) select at least one Measure Bundle with at least  one required three-point measure for which its denominator for the  baseline measurement period has significant volume; or  (ii) select at least one Measure Bundle with at least  one optional three-point measure for which its denominator for the  baseline measurement period has significant volume, and select at  least one optional three-point measure in that Measure Bundle for  which its denominator for the baseline measurement period has significant  volume.  (G) A hospital or physician practice with an MPT of  75 must select at least one Measure Bundle with at least one population-based  clinical outcome measure as specified in the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (H) A hospital or physician practice may only select  an optional measure in a selected Measure Bundle for which its denominator  for the baseline measurement period has significant volume.  (I) Only a hospital with a valuation less than or equal  to $2,500,000 per DY for DY7-8 may select a Measure Bundle identified  as a rural Measure Bundle in accordance with the requirements in the  Measure Bundle Protocol. (J) If a hospital or physician practice has a limited  scope of practice, cannot reasonably report on at least half of the  required measures in the Measure Bundle(s) appropriate for it based  on its scope of practice and community partnerships, and consequently  cannot meet its MPT for Measure Bundle selection, the hospital or  physician practice may request HHSC approval to select measures, rather  than Measure Bundles, from the Measure Bundle Protocol. The hospital  or physician practice must submit a request for such approval to HHSC  prior to the RHP plan update submission, by a date determined by HHSC.  Such a request may be subject to review by the Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS). If HHSC and CMS, as appropriate, approve  such a request, the following requirements apply:  (i) the hospital's or physician practice's total valuation  for DY7 and DY8 may be reduced; (ii) the hospital or physician practice must select  measures from the following menus of the Measure Bundle Protocol in  accordance with the requirements in clauses (iii) - (v) of this subparagraph  in the RHP plan update for its RHP: (I) the Measure Bundles on the Hospital and Physician  Practice Measure Bundle Menu;  (II) the Community Mental Health Center Measure Menu;  or  (III) the Local Health Department Measure Menu;  (iii) each measure in a Measure Bundle on the Hospital  and Physician Practice Measure Bundle Menu, and each measure on the  Community Mental Health Center Measure Menu and the Local Health Department  Measure Menu, is assigned a point value as described in the Measure  Bundle Protocol;  (iv) the hospital or physician practice is assigned  an MPT for measure selection as described in paragraphs (5) and (6)  of this subsection; and  (v) the hospital or physician practice must select  measures worth enough points to meet its MPT in order to maintain  its total valuation for DY7 and DY8. If the hospital or physician  practice does not select measures worth enough points to meet its  MPT, its total DY7 valuation will be reduced proportionately across  its RHP Plan Update and Categories B-D funds for DY7, and its total  DY8 valuation will be reduced proportionately across its Categories  B-D funds for DY8, based on the point values of the measures it selects.  (2) DSRIP-attributed population. A hospital or physician  practice must determine its DSRIP-attributed population to be applied  to its selected Measure Bundles and measures as specified in the Measure  Bundle Protocol.  (3) Measure Bundle valuation. A hospital or physician  practice may allocate its Category C valuation among its selected  Measure Bundles in the RHP plan update for its RHP as it chooses,  provided the following requirements are met: (A) The valuation for each selected Measure Bundle  must be greater than or equal to (the Measure Bundle point value divided  by the sum of all the selected Measure Bundles' point values) multiplied  by 0.75 multiplied by the Category C valuation. (B) The valuation for each selected Measure Bundle  without any required or selected optional three-point measures must  be less than or equal to (the Measure Bundle point value divided by  the sum of all the selected Measure Bundles' point values) multiplied  by the Category C valuation.  (C) The valuation for each selected Measure Bundle  with a required or selected optional three-point measure must be less  than or equal to (the Measure Bundle point value divided by the sum  of all the selected Measure Bundles' point values) multiplied by 1.25  multiplied by the Category C valuation.  (D) If a hospital or physician practice allocates to  a Measure Bundle a percentage of its Category C valuation that is  one percent greater than the Measure Bundle's point value as a percentage  of all the selected Measure Bundles' point values, the hospital or  physician practice must provide sufficient justification as specified  in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol. (4) Measure valuation. The valuation for each measure  in a selected Measure Bundle is equal to the Measure Bundle valuation  divided by the number of measures in the selected Measure Bundle,  so that the valuations of the measures in the selected Measure Bundle  are equal, with the following exceptions:  (A) If a Measure Bundle includes an innovative measure:  (i) the valuation for each innovative measure in the  Measure Bundle is equal to the Measure Bundle valuation divided by  the number of the measures in the Measure Bundle subtracted by 0.5  for each innovative measure and divided by 2; and  (ii) the valuation for each measure in the Measure  Bundle that is not an innovative measure is equal to the Measure Bundle  valuation divided by the number of measures in the Measure Bundle  subtracted by 0.5 for each innovative measure. (B) If a hospital's or physician practice's denominator  for a required measure or numerator for a population-based clinical  outcome measure in a selected Measure Bundle for the baseline measurement  period or a performance year has no volume, the measure is removed  from the Measure Bundle, and its valuation for the applicable DY is  redistributed among the remaining measures in the Measure Bundle for  which the hospital's or physician practice's denominator for the baseline  measurement period or performance year has significant volume for  the applicable DY. The valuation for the applicable DY for each of  the remaining measures in the Measure Bundle for which the hospital's  or physician practice's denominator for the baseline measurement period  or performance year has significant volume is equal to the valuation  for the Measure Bundle for the applicable DY divided by the number  of measures for which the hospital's or physician practice's denominator  for the baseline measurement period or performance year has significant  volume, so that the valuations for the applicable DY for the measures  in the Measure Bundle for which the hospital's or physician practice's  denominator for the baseline measurement period or performance year  has significant volume are equal.  (C) If a hospital's or physician practice's denominator  for a required measure or numerator for a P4R population-based clinical  outcome measure in a selected Measure Bundle for the baseline measurement  period or a performance year has insignificant volume, the measure's  milestone valuations are adjusted in accordance with subsection (e)(2)  of this section.  (5) Milestone valuation. The measure milestones and  corresponding valuations for DY7-8 are as described in subsection  (e) of this section.  (6) MPTs for hospitals.  (A) The MPT for hospitals, with the exception of those  described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, is calculated  as follows:  (i) First, the hospital's statewide hospital factor  (SHF) is equal to (.64 multiplied by (the hospital's Medicaid and  uninsured inpatient days divided by the sum of all hospitals' Medicaid  and uninsured inpatient days)) plus (.36 multiplied by (the hospital's  Medicaid and uninsured outpatient costs divided by the sum of all  hospitals' Medicaid and uninsured outpatient costs)).  (ii) Second, the hospital's statewide hospital ratio  (SHR) is equal to (the hospital's DY7 valuation divided by the sum  of all hospitals' DY7 valuations) divided by the SHF.  (iii) Third, the hospital's MPT is determined as follows:  (I) If the SHR is less than or equal to 3, the MPT  is the lesser of:  (-a-) the DY7 valuation divided by $500,000; or  (-b-) 75.  (II) If the SHR is greater than 3 but less than or  equal to 10, the MPT is the lesser of:  (-a-) (the DY7 valuation divided by $500,000 multiplied  by (the SHR divided by 3); or  (-b-) 75.  (III) If the SHR is greater than 10 and the DY7 valuation  is less than or equal to $15 million, the MPT is the lesser of:  (-a-) (the DY7 valuation divided by $500,000 multiplied  by (the SHR divided by 3); or  (-b-) 40.  (IV) If the SHR is greater than 10 and the DY7 valuation  is greater than $15 million, the MPT is the lesser of:  (-a-) (the DY7 valuation divided by $500,000 multiplied  by (the SHR divided by 3); or  (-b-) 75.  (B) If a hospital does not have the data needed for  the SHF calculation in paragraph (5)(A)(i) of this subsection, or  if a hospital did not participate in DSRIP during the initial demonstration  period or DY6, its MPT is the lesser of: (i) the hospital's DY7 valuation divided by $500,000;  or  (ii) 75.  (C) If a hospital has a limited scope of practice,  cannot reasonably report on at least half of the required measures  in the Measure Bundle(s) appropriate for it based on its scope of  practice and community partnerships, and consequently cannot meet  its MPT for Measure Bundle selection, the hospital may request HHSC  approval for a reduced MPT equal to the sum of the points for all  the Measure Bundles for which the hospital could reasonably report  on at least half of the required measures in the Measure Bundle. The  hospital must submit a request for such approval to HHSC prior to  the RHP plan update submission, by a date determined by HHSC. Such  a request may be subject to review by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS). If HHSC and CMS, as appropriate, approve  such a request, the hospital's total valuation for DY7 and DY8 may  be reduced.  (7) MPTs for physician practices.  (A) The MPT for physician practices, with the exception  of those described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, is the lesser  of:  (i) the physician practice's DY7 valuation divided  by $500,000; or  (ii) 75.  (B) If a physician practice has a limited scope of  practice, cannot reasonably report on at least half of the required  measures in the Measure Bundles appropriate for it based on its scope  of practice and community partnerships, and consequently cannot meet  its MPT for Measure Bundle selection, the physician practice may request  HHSC approval for a reduced MPT equal to the sum of the points for  all the Measure Bundles for which the physician practice could reasonably  report on at least half of the required measures in the Measure Bundle.  The physician practice must submit a request for such approval to  HHSC prior to the RHP plan update submission, by a date determined  by HHSC. Such a request may be subject to review by CMS. If HHSC and  CMS, as appropriate, approve such a request, the physician practice's  total valuation for DY7 and DY8 may be reduced.  (b) Requirements for community mental health centers  (CMHCs).

(1) Measure Bundle and measure selection.  (A) A hospital or physician practice, with the exception  of those described in subparagraph (J) of this paragraph, must select  Measure Bundles from the Hospital and Physician Practice Measure Bundle  Menu of the Measure Bundle Protocol in accordance with the requirements  in subparagraphs (B) - (I) of this paragraph in the RHP plan update  for DY9-10 for its RHP.  (B) Each Measure Bundle is assigned a point value for  DY9-10 as described in the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (C) A hospital or physician practice is assigned a  minimum point threshold (MPT) for Measure Bundle selection as described  in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subsection.  (D) A hospital or physician practice must select Measure  Bundles worth enough points to meet its MPT in order to maintain its  total valuation for DY9 and DY10. If a hospital or physician practice  does not select Measure Bundles worth enough points to meet its MPT,  its total DY9 valuation will be reduced proportionately across its  Categories B-D funds for DY9, and its total DY10 valuation will be  reduced proportionately across its Categories B-D funds for DY10,  based on the point values of the Measure Bundles it selects.  (E) A hospital or physician practice may request to  delete a maximum of 20 points worth of its DY7-8 Measure Bundles and  measures for DY9-10 with good cause. In this context, good cause is  defined as:  (i) a significant system change, such as a hospital  merger;  (ii) updated community needs; or  (iii) a significant change in a Measure Bundle's required  system component of outpatient services or hospital services as described  in the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (F) A hospital or physician practice may only select  a Measure Bundle for which its denominators for the baseline measurement  period for at least half of the required measures in the Measure Bundle  have significant volume.  (G) A hospital or physician practice with a valuation  greater than $2,500,000 per demonstration year (DY) for DY7-8 or with  a valuation greater than $2,000,000 in DY10 must:  (i) select at least one Measure Bundle with at least  one required three-point measure for which its denominator for the  baseline measurement period has significant volume; or  (ii) select at least one Measure Bundle with at least  one optional three-point measure for which its denominator for the  baseline measurement period has significant volume and select at least  one optional three-point measure in that Measure Bundle for which  its denominator for the baseline measurement period has significant  volume.  (H) A hospital or physician practice with an MPT of  75 must report at least two population-based clinical outcome measures  as P4P as specified in the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (I) A hospital or physician practice may only select  an optional measure in a selected Measure Bundle for which its denominator  for the baseline measurement period has significant volume.  (J) If a hospital or physician practice has a limited  scope of practice, cannot reasonably report on at least half of the  required measures in the Measure Bundle(s) appropriate for it based  on its scope of practice and community partnerships, and consequently  cannot meet its MPT for Measure Bundle selection, the hospital or  physician practice may request HHSC approval to select measures, rather  than Measure Bundles, from the Measure Bundle Protocol. The hospital  or physician practice must submit a request for such approval to HHSC  prior to the RHP plan update for DY9-10 submission, by a date determined  by HHSC. Such a request may be subject to review by the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). If HHSC and CMS, as appropriate,  approve such a request, the following requirements apply:  (i) the hospital's or physician practice's total valuation  for DY9 and DY10 may be reduced;  (ii) the hospital or physician practice must select  measures from the following menus of the Measure Bundle Protocol in  accordance with the requirements in clauses (iii) - (v) of this subparagraph  in the RHP plan update for its RHP:  (I) the Measure Bundles on the Hospital and Physician  Practice Measure Bundle Menu;  (II) the Community Mental Health Center Measure Menu;  or  (III) the Local Health Department Measure Menu;  (iii) each measure in a Measure Bundle on the Hospital  and Physician Practice Measure Bundle Menu, and each measure on the  Community Mental Health Center Measure Menu and the Local Health Department  Measure Menu, is assigned a point value as described in the Measure  Bundle Protocol;  (iv) the hospital or physician practice is assigned  an MPT for measure selection as described in paragraphs (5) and (6)  of this subsection; and  (v) the hospital or physician practice must select  measures worth enough points to meet its MPT in order to maintain  its total valuation for DY9 and DY10. If the hospital or physician  practice does not select measures worth enough points to meet its  MPT, its total DY9 valuation will be reduced proportionately across  its Categories B-D funds for DY9, and its total DY10 valuation will  be reduced proportionately across its Categories B-D funds for DY10,  based on the point values of the measures it selects.  (2) DSRIP-attributed population. A hospital or physician  practice must determine its DSRIP-attributed population to be applied  to its selected Measure Bundles and measures as specified in the Measure  Bundle Protocol.  (3) Measure Bundle valuation. Each Measure Bundle selected  by a hospital or physician practice for DY9-10 is allocated a percentage  of the hospital's or physician practice's Category C valuation that  is equal to the Measure Bundle's point value as a percentage of all  of the hospital's or physician practice's selected Measure Bundles'  point values.  (4) Measure valuation. The valuation for each measure  in a selected Measure Bundle is equal to the Measure Bundle valuation  divided by the number of measures in the selected Measure Bundle,  so that the valuations of the measures in the selected Measure Bundle  are equal, with the following exceptions:  (A) If a Measure Bundle includes the innovative measure:  (i) the valuation for the innovative measure in the  Measure Bundle is equal to the Measure Bundle valuation divided by  the number of measures in the Measure Bundle subtracted by 0.5 for  the innovative measure and divided by 2; and  (ii) the valuation for each measure in the Measure  Bundle that is not the innovative measure is equal to the Measure  Bundle valuation divided by the number of measures in the Measure  Bundle subtracted by 0.5 for the innovative measure.  (B) If a hospital's or physician practice's denominator  for a required measure or numerator for a population-based clinical  outcome measure in a selected Measure Bundle for the baseline measurement  period or a performance year has no volume, the measure is removed  from the Measure Bundle, and its valuation for the applicable DY is  redistributed among the remaining measures in the Measure Bundle for  which the hospital's or physician practice's denominator for the baseline  measurement period or performance year has significant volume for  the applicable DY. The valuation for the applicable DY for each of  the remaining measures is equal to the valuation for the Measure Bundle  for the applicable DY divided by the number of measures for which  the hospital's or physician practice's denominator for the baseline  measurement period or performance year has significant volume, so  that the valuations for the applicable DY for the measures in the  Measure Bundle for which the hospital's or physician practice's denominator  for the baseline measurement period or performance year has significant  volume are equal.  (C) If a hospital's or physician practice's denominator  for a required measure or numerator for a P4R population-based clinical  outcome measure in a selected Measure Bundle for the baseline measurement  period or a performance year has insignificant volume, the measure's  milestone valuations are adjusted in accordance with subsection (e)(2)  of this section.  (5) Milestone valuation. The measure milestones and  corresponding valuations for DY9-10 are as described in subsection  (e) of this section.  (6) MPTs for hospitals.  (A) The MPT for hospitals, with the exception of those  described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, is calculated  as follows:  (i) First, the hospital's statewide hospital factor  (SHF) is equal to (.64 multiplied by (the hospital's Medicaid and  uninsured inpatient days divided by the sum of all hospitals' Medicaid  and uninsured inpatient days)) plus (.36 multiplied by (the hospital's  Medicaid and uninsured outpatient costs divided by the sum of all  hospitals' Medicaid and uninsured outpatient costs)). A hospital's  Medicaid and uninsured inpatient days and uninsured outpatient costs  are those reported for federal fiscal year 2016 in the Texas Hospital  Uncompensated Care Tool.  (ii) Second, the hospital's statewide hospital ratio  (SHR) is equal to (the hospital's DY10 valuation divided by the sum  of all hospitals' DY10 valuations) divided by the SHF.  (iii) Third, the hospital's MPT is determined as follows: (I) If the SHR is less than or equal to 3, the MPT  is the lesser of:  (-a-) the DY10 valuation divided by $500,000; or  (-b-) 75.  (II) If the SHR is greater than 3 but less than or  equal to 10, the MPT is the lesser of:  (-a-) (the DY10 valuation divided by $500,000 multiplied  by (the SHR divided by 3); or  (-b-) 75.  (III) If the SHR is greater than 10 and the DY10 valuation  is less than or equal to $15 million, the MPT is the lesser of:  (-a-) the DY10 valuation divided by $500,000 multiplied  by (the SHR divided by 3); or  (-b-) 40.  (IV) If the SHR is greater than 10 and the DY10 valuation  is greater than $15 million, the MPT is the lesser of:  (-a-) the DY10 valuation divided by $500,000 multiplied  by (the SHR divided by 3); or  (-b-) 75.  (B) If a hospital does not have the data needed for  the SHF calculation in paragraph (5)(A)(i) of this subsection, or  if a hospital did not participate in DSRIP during the initial demonstration  period or DY6, its MPT is the lesser of:  (i) the hospital's DY10 valuation divided by $500,000;  or  (ii) 75.  (C) The MPT for a hospital for DY9-10 must not be reduced  by more than 10 points from the hospital's MPT for DY7-8.  (D) If a hospital has a limited scope of practice,  cannot reasonably report on at least half of the required measures  in the Measure Bundle(s) appropriate for it based on its scope of  practice and community partnerships, and consequently cannot meet  its MPT for Measure Bundle selection, the hospital may request HHSC  approval for a reduced MPT equal to the sum of the points for all  the Measure Bundles for which the hospital could reasonably report  on at least half of the required measures in the Measure Bundle. The  hospital must submit a request for such approval to HHSC prior to  the RHP plan update submission, by a date determined by HHSC. Such  a request may be subject to review by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS). If HHSC and CMS, as appropriate, approve  such a request, the hospital's total valuation for DY9 and DY10 may  be reduced.  (7) MPTs for physician practices.  (A) The MPT for a physician practice for DY9-10, with  the exception of a physician practice described in subparagraph (C)  of this paragraph, is the lesser of:  (i) the physician practice's DY10 valuation divided  by $500,000; or  (ii) 75.  (B) The MPT for a physician practice for DY9-10 must  not be reduced by more than 10 points from the physician practice's  MPT for DY7-8.  (C) If a physician practice has a limited scope of  practice, cannot reasonably report on at least half of the required  measures in the Measure Bundles appropriate for it based on its scope  of practice and community partnerships, and consequently cannot meet  its MPT for Measure Bundle selection, the physician practice may request  HHSC approval for a reduced MPT equal to the sum of the points for  all the Measure Bundles for which the physician practice could reasonably  report on at least half of the required measures in the Measure Bundle.  The physician practice must submit a request for such approval to  HHSC prior to the RHP plan update submission, by a date determined  by HHSC. Such a request may be subject to review by CMS. If HHSC and  CMS, as appropriate, approve such a request, the physician practice's  total valuation for DY9 and DY10 may be reduced.  (b) Requirements for community mental health centers  (CMHCs).  (1) Measure selection.  (A) A CMHC must select measures from the Community  Mental Health Center Measure Menu of the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (B) Each measure is assigned a point value as described  in the Measure Bundle Protocol.  (C) A CMHC is assigned an MPT for measure selection  as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection.

Allowable and  unallowable costs, both direct and indirect, are defined to identify  expenses that are reasonable and necessary to provide contracted client  care and are consistent with federal and state laws and regulations.  When a particular type of expense is classified as unallowable, the  classification means only that the expense will not be included in  the database for reimbursement determination purposes because the  expense is not considered reasonable and/or necessary. The classification  does not mean that individual contracted providers may not make the  expenditure. The description of allowable and unallowable costs is  designed to be a general guide and to clarify certain key expense  areas. This description is not comprehensive, and the failure to identify  a particular cost does not necessarily mean that the cost is an allowable  or unallowable cost.  (b) Cost-reporting process. The primary objective of  the cost-reporting process is to provide a basis for determining appropriate  reimbursement to contracted providers. To achieve this objective,  the reimbursement determination process uses allowable cost information  reported on cost reports or other surveys. The cost report collects  actual allowable costs and other financial and statistical information,  as required. Costs may not be imputed and reported on the cost report  when no costs were actually incurred (except as stated in §355.103(b)(19)(A)(i)  of this title (relating to Specifications for Allowable and Unallowable  Costs) or when documentation does not exist for costs even if they  were actually incurred during the reporting period).  (c) Accurate cost reporting. Accurate cost reporting  is the responsibility of the contracted provider. The contracted provider  is responsible for including in the cost report all costs incurred,  based on an accrual method of accounting, which are reasonable and  necessary, in accordance with allowable and unallowable cost guidelines  in this section and in §355.103 of this title, revenue reporting  guidelines in §355.104 of this title (relating to Revenues),  cost report instructions, and applicable program rules. Reporting  all allowable costs on the cost report is the responsibility of the  contracted provider. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission  (HHSC) is not responsible for the contracted provider's failure to  report allowable costs; however, in an effort to collect reliable,  accurate, and verifiable financial and statistical data, HHSC is responsible  for providing cost report training, general and/or specific cost report  instructions, and technical assistance to providers. Furthermore,  if unreported and/or understated allowable costs are discovered during  the course of an audit desk review or field audit, those allowable  costs will be included on the cost report or brought to the attention  of the provider to correct by submitting an amended cost report.  (d) Cost and accountability report training. It is  the responsibility of the provider to ensure that each cost or accountability  report preparer has completed the required state-sponsored training.  Preparers may be employees of the provider or persons who have been  contracted by the provider for the purpose of cost or accountability  report preparation. Preparers must complete training for each program  for which a cost or accountability report is submitted, as applicable.  Contracted preparer's fees to complete training are considered allowable  expenses for cost reporting purposes. Preparers that participate in  training may be assessed a convenience fee, which will be determined  by HHSC. Convenience fees assessed for training are allowable costs.  Applicable federal and state accessibility standards apply to training.  Beginning with the 2018 cost reports and 2019 accountability reports,  reporting schedules per program are determined by HHSC and are published  on the HHSC website.  (1) Training schedules. (A) For programs with odd-year and even-year cost reports.  Preparers must complete state-sponsored cost report training every  other year in order to be eligible to complete both that odd-year  cost report and the following even-year cost report. If a new preparer  wishes to complete an even-year cost report and has not completed  the previous odd-year cost report training, the preparer must complete  an even-year cost report training.  (B) For programs with odd-year and even-year accountability  reports. Preparers must complete state-sponsored accountability report  training every other year in order to be eligible to complete both  that odd-year accountability report and the following even-year accountability  report. If a new preparer wishes to complete an even-year accountability  report and has not completed the previous odd-year accountability  report training, the preparer must complete an even-year accountability  report training.  (C) For all other programs. Preparers must complete  the state-sponsored training for each program for which a cost or  accountability report is submitted. Beginning with the 2018 cost reports,  new preparers must complete cost report training every other year  for each program cost or accountability report being prepared in order  to be eligible to complete both that year's cost report and the following  year's accountability report, if applicable. If a new preparer wishes  to complete an accountability report and has not completed the previous  year's cost report training, the preparer must complete an accountability  report training for that program for that year.  (2) Failure to complete the required cost or accountability  report training.  (A) For nursing facilities, failure to file a completed  cost or accountability report signed by preparers who have completed  the required cost report training may result in vendor hold as specified  in §355.403 of this title (relating to Vendor Hold).  (B) For School Health and Related Services (SHARS)  providers, failure to complete the required cost report training may  result in an administrative contract violation as specified in §355.8443  of this title.  (C) For all other programs, failure to file a completed  cost or accountability report signed by preparers who have completed  the required cost report training constitutes an administrative contract  violation. In the case of an administrative contract violation, procedural  guidelines and informal reconsideration and/or appeal processes are  specified in §355.111 of this title (relating to Administrative  Contract Violations).  (e) Generally accepted accounting principles. Except  as otherwise specified by the cost determination process rules of  this chapter, cost report instructions, or policy clarifications,  cost reports should be prepared consistent with generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP), which are those principles approved  by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) laws and regulations do not necessarily  apply in the preparation of the cost report. In cases where cost reporting  rules differ from GAAP, IRS, or other authorities, HHSC rules take  precedence for provider cost-reporting purposes.  (f) Allowable costs. Allowable costs are expenses,  both direct and indirect, that are reasonable and necessary, as defined  in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and which meet the requirements  as specified in subsections (i), (j), and (k) of this section, in  the normal conduct of operations to provide contracted client services  meeting all pertinent state and federal requirements. Only allowable  costs are included in the reimbursement determination process.  (1) ""Reasonable"" refers to the amount expended. The  test of reasonableness includes the expectation that the provider  seeks to minimize costs and that the amount expended does not exceed  what a prudent and cost-conscious buyer pays for a given item or service.  In determining the reasonableness of a given cost, the following are  considered:  (A) the restraints or requirements imposed by arm's-length  bargaining, i.e., transactions with nonowners or other unrelated parties,  federal and state laws and regulations, and contract terms and specifications;  and  (B) the action that a prudent person would take in  similar circumstances, considering his responsibilities to the public,  the government, his employees, clients, shareholders, and members,  and the fulfillment of the purpose for which the business was organized. (2) ""Necessary"" refers to the relationship of the cost,  direct or indirect, incurred by a provider to the provision of contracted  client care. Necessary costs are direct and indirect costs that are  appropriate in developing and maintaining the required standard of  operation for providing client care in accordance with the contract  and state and federal regulations. In addition, to qualify as a necessary  expense, a direct or indirect cost must meet all of the following  requirements:  (A) the expenditure was not for personal or other activities  not directly or indirectly related to the provision of contracted  services;  (B) the cost does not appear as a specific unallowable  cost in §355.103 of this title;  (C) if a direct cost, it bears a significant relationship  to contracted client care. To qualify as significant, the elimination  of the expenditure would have an adverse impact on client health,  safety, or general well-being;  (D) the direct or indirect expense was incurred in  the purchase of materials, supplies, or services provided to clients  or staff in the normal conduct of operations to provide contracted  client care;  (E) the direct or indirect costs are not allocable  to or included as a cost of any other program in either the current,  a prior, or a future cost-reporting period;  (F) the costs are net of all applicable credits;  (G) allocated costs of each program are adequately  substantiated; and  (H) the costs are not prohibited under other pertinent  federal, state, or local laws or regulations.  (3) Direct costs are those costs incurred by a provider  that are definitely attributable to the operation of providing contracted  client services. Direct costs include, but are not limited to, salaries  and nonlabor costs necessary for the provision of contracted client  care. Whether or not a cost is considered a direct cost depends upon  the specific contracted client services covered by the program. In  programs in which client meals are covered program services, the salaries  of cooks and other food service personnel are direct costs, as are  food, nonfood supplies, and other such dietary costs. In programs  in which client transportation is a covered program service, the salaries  of drivers are direct costs, as are vehicle repairs and maintenance,  vehicle insurance and depreciation, and other such client transportation  costs.  (4) Indirect costs are those costs that benefit, or  contribute to, the operation of providing contracted services, other  business components, or the overall contracted entity. These costs  could include, but are not limited to, administration salaries and  nonlabor costs, building costs, insurance expense, and interest expense.  Central office or home office administrative expenses are considered  indirect costs. As specified in §355.8443 of this title, SHARS  providers use an unrestricted indirect cost rate to determine indirect  costs.  (g) Unallowable costs. Unallowable costs are expenses  that are not reasonable or necessary, according to the criteria specified  in subsection (f)(1) - (2) of this section and which do not meet the  requirements as specified in subsections (i), (j), and (k) of this  section or which are specifically enumerated in §355.103 of this  title or program-specific reimbursement methodology. Providers must  not report as an allowable cost on a cost report a cost that has been  determined to be unallowable. Such reporting may constitute fraud.  (Refer to §355.106(a) of this title (relating to Basic Objectives  and Criteria for Audit and Desk Review of Cost Reports)).  (1) For nursing facilities, placement as an allowable  cost on a cost report of a cost which has been determined to be unallowable  may result in vendor hold as specified in §355.403 of this title.  (2) For Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals  with an Intellectual Disability or Related Conditions (ICF/IID), Home  and Community-based Services (HCS), Service Coordination/Targeted  Case Management, Rehabilitative Services, and Texas Home Living (TxHmL)  programs, placement as an allowable cost on a cost report a cost,  which has been determined to be unallowable, constitutes an administrative  contract violation. In the case of an administrative contract violation,  procedural guidelines and informal reconsideration and/or appeal processes  are specified in §355.111 of this title.  (3) For SHARS providers, submission of a cost that  has been determined to be unallowable may result in an administrative  contract violation as specified in §355.8443 of this title.  (4) For all other programs, submission of a cost, which  has been determined to be unallowable, constitutes an administrative  contract violation. In the case of an administrative contract violation,  procedural guidelines and informal reconsideration and/or appeal processes  are specified in §355.111 of this title.  (h) Other financial and statistical data. The primary  purpose of the cost report is to collect allowable costs to be used  as a basis for reimbursement determination. In addition, providers  may be required on cost reports to provide information in addition  to allowable costs to support allowable costs, such as wage surveys,  workers' compensation surveys, or other statistical and financial  information. Additional data requested may include, when specified  and in the appropriate section or line number specified, costs incurred  by Cont'd..."

See subsection  (b)(13) of this section. (b) Allowable and unallowable costs. (1) Compensation of employees. Compensation includes  both cash and non-cash forms of compensation subject to federal payroll  tax regulations. Compensation includes wages and salaries (including  bonuses); payroll taxes and insurance; and benefits. Payroll taxes  and insurance include Federal Insurance Contributions Act (old age,  survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) and Medicare hospital  insurance); Unemployment Compensation Insurance; and Workers' Compensation  Insurance. (A) Allowable compensation of employees is compensation  paid to employees in arm's-length transactions as nonowners and non-related  parties and is subject to the reasonable and necessary costs which  must be incurred by providers in the provision of contracted client  services. Guidelines for compensation of owners and related parties  are specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection. (i) A bonus is a type of compensation granted to employees  as a wage enhancement. Bonuses paid to employees in arm's-length transactions  are allowable costs, subject to the reasonable and necessary costs  that must be incurred by providers in the provision of contracted  client services. In determining the employee classification type,  part-time employees may be considered a different classification type  than full-time employees. To be allowable, bonuses to owners and/or  related parties: (I) must not represent any form of profit sharing and  must not be determined on the level of profit earned by the contracted  provider; (II) must be clearly defined in a written agreement  or employment policy; (III) must not be made only to related parties, in  which case the bonuses are unallowable costs; (IV) must be based upon the same criteria for all members  of the same employee classification type; (V) must be made available to all employees of the  same classification type, unless the employee classification type  predominantly consists of related parties, in which case the bonuses  are unallowable costs; and (VI) must not discriminate in favor of certain employees,  such as employees who are officers, stockholders, or the highest paid  individual(s) of the organization. (ii) Payroll taxes and insurance are described in paragraph  (12) of this subsection, concerning tax expense and credits, and paragraph  (13) of this subsection. (iii) Benefits are amounts paid to or on behalf of  an employee, in addition to direct salary or wages, and from which  the employee, his dependent, or his beneficiary derives a personal  benefit before or after the employee's retirement or death. (I) Benefits paid to employees in arm's length transactions  as nonowners and non-related parties are allowable costs, subject  to the reasonable and necessary costs which must be incurred by providers  in the provision of contracted client care. To be allowable, benefits  paid to owners and/or related parties must not discriminate in favor  of certain employees, such as employees who are officers, stockholders,  or the highest paid individual(s) of the organization. (II) Allowable benefits are reported on cost reports  either as salaries and/or wages, as employee benefits, or as costs  applicable to specific cost report line items, as specified in this  subclause and in subclause (III) of this clause. Any benefit subject  to payroll taxes is reported as salaries and wages. Allowable benefits  that are routinely reported as salaries and wages include paid vacations,  paid holidays, sick leave, voting leave, court or jury duty leave,  and/or all-inclusive paid days, as specified in subclause (III)(-c-)  of this clause. Allowable benefits which are routinely reported as  employee benefits include employer contributions to certain deferred  compensation plans, as specified in subclause (III)(-a-) of this clause,  employer contributions to an employee retirement fund or certain pension  plans, as specified in subclause (III)(-b-) of this clause, and costs  of certain employer-paid health, life, and disability insurance premiums,  as specified in subclause (III)(-f-) of this clause. The contracted  provider's unrecovered cost of meals and room and board furnished  to direct care employees, uniforms, employee personal vehicle mileage  reimbursement in accordance with paragraph (15) of this subsection,  job-related training reimbursements in accordance with paragraph (15)  of this subsection, and job certification renewal fees in accordance  with paragraph (15) of this subsection are not to be reported as benefits  but are to be reported as costs applicable to specific cost report  line items, unless they are subject to payroll taxes, whereas they  are reported as salaries and wages. (III) Benefits include the following: (-a-) Employer contributions to certain deferred compensation  plans are reported as employee benefits. Deferred compensation is  remuneration currently earned by an employee but which is not received  until a subsequent period, usually after retirement. For the cost  to be allowable, the deferred compensation plan must be formal, established,  and maintained by the contracted provider and communicated to all  eligible employees. A formal plan is one that is provided for in a  written agreement executed between the contracted provider and the  participating employees. The plan must: (-1-) prescribe the method for calculating all contributions  to the fund; (-2-) be funded with contributions made systematically  to a funding agency outside the contracted provider's ownership or  control, such as a trustee, an insurance company, or a custodial bank  account; (-3-) provide for the protection of the plan's assets; (-4-) designate the requirements for vested benefits; (-5-) provide the basis for the computation of the  amounts of benefits to be paid; (-6-) be expected to continue despite normal fluctuations  in the contracted provider's economic experience; and (-7-) use all fund contributions and earnings for the  sole benefit of the participating employees. Contributions made during  the cost-reporting period to a deferred compensation plan meeting  the requirements specified in subitems (-1-) - (-7-) of this item  which represent legal obligations of the contracted provider and which  are clearly enumerated as to dollar amount are allowable costs and  should be reported on cost reports as employee benefits. Reasonable  trustee or custodial fees paid by the contracted provider will be  allowed as an administrative cost. However, such fees will not be  allowable where the deferred compensation plan provides that they  will be paid out of the corpus or earnings of the fund. To be allowable,  contributions representing the employee's share cannot revert to the  contracted provider. However employer-paid contributions can revert  back to the contracted provider in the event an employee does not  vest if designated in the requirements for vested benefits. (-b-) Employer contributions to an employee retirement  fund or certain pension plans are reported as employee benefits. A  pension plan is a type of deferred compensation plan which is established  and maintained by the employer to provide systematic payment of definitely  determinable benefits to its employees over a period of years, or  for life, after retirement. Such a plan may include disability, withdrawal,  option for lump-sum payment, or insurance or survivorship benefits  incidental and directly related to the pension benefits. A pension  plan must meet all the Cont'd..."

Except where otherwise specified  under this title, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)  follows the requirements, methods, and procedures set forth in this  section to determine costs appropriate for use in the reimbursement  determination process.  (b) Cost report requirements. Unless specifically stated  in program rules or excused as described in paragraph (4)(D) of this  subsection, each provider must submit financial and statistical information  on cost report forms provided by HHSC, or on facsimiles that are formatted  according to HHSC specifications and are pre-approved by HHSC staff,  or electronically in HHSC-prescribed format in programs where these  systems are operational. The cost reports must be submitted to HHSC  in a manner prescribed by HHSC. The cost reports must be prepared  to reflect the activities of the provider while delivering contracted  services during the fiscal year specified by the cost report. Cost  reports or other special surveys or reports may be required for other  periods at the discretion of HHSC. Each provider is responsible for  accurately completing any cost report or other special survey or report  submitted to HHSC.  (1) Accounting methods. All financial and statistical  information submitted on cost reports must be based upon the accrual  method of accounting, except where otherwise specified in §355.102  and §355.103 of this title (relating to General Principles of  Allowable and Unallowable Costs, and Specifications for Allowable  and Unallowable Costs) and in the case of governmental entities operating  on a cash or modified accrual basis. For cost-reporting purposes,  accrued expenses must be incurred during the cost reporting period  and must be paid within 180 days after the end of that cost reporting  period. In situations where a contracted provider, any of its controlling  entities, its parent company/sole member, or its related-party management  company has filed for bankruptcy protection, the contracted provider  may request an exception to the 180-day requirement for payment of  accrued allowable expenses by submitting a written request to the  HHSC Rate Analysis Department. The written request must be submitted  within 60 days of the date of the bankruptcy filing or at least 60  days prior to the due date of the cost report for which the exception  is being requested, whichever is later. The contracted provider will  then be requested by the HHSC Rate Analysis Department to provide  certain documentation, which must be provided by the specified due  date. Such exceptions due to bankruptcy may be granted for reasonable,  necessary and documented accrued allowable expenses that were not  paid within the 180-day requirement. Accrued revenues must be for  services performed during the cost reporting period and do not have  to be received within 180 days after the end of that cost reporting  period in order to be reported as revenues for cost-reporting purposes.  Except as otherwise specified by the cost determination process rules  of this chapter, cost report instructions, or policy clarifications,  cost reports should be prepared consistent with generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP), which are those principles approved  by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) laws and regulations do not necessarily  apply in the preparation of the cost report. In cases where cost reporting  rules differ from GAAP, IRS, or other authorities, HHSC rules take  precedence for provider cost-reporting purposes.  (2) Recordkeeping and adequate documentation. There  is a distinction between noncompliance in recordkeeping, which equates  with unauditability of a cost report and constitutes an administrative  contract violation or, for the Nursing Facility program, may result  in vendor hold, and a provider's inability to provide adequate documentation,  which results in disallowance of relevant costs. Each is discussed  in the following paragraphs.  (A) Recordkeeping. Providers must ensure that records  are accurate and sufficiently detailed to support the legal, financial,  and other statistical information contained in the cost report. Providers  must maintain all workpapers and any other records that support the  information submitted on the cost report relating to all allocations,  cost centers, cost or statistical line items, surveys, and schedules.  HHSC may require supporting documentation other than that contained  in the cost report to substantiate reported information.  (i) For Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services  (DADS)-contracted providers, each provider must maintain records according  to the requirements stated in 40 TAC §69.158 (relating to How  long must contractors, subrecipients, and subcontractors keep contract-related  records?) and according to the HHSC's prescribed chart of accounts,  when available.  (ii) If a contractor is terminating business operations,  the contractor must ensure that:  (I) records are stored and accessible; and  (II) someone is responsible for adequately maintaining  the records.  (iii) For nursing facilities, failure to maintain all  workpapers and any other records that support the information submitted  on the cost report relating to all allocations, cost centers, cost  or statistical line items, surveys and schedules may result in vendor  hold as specified in §355.403 of this title (relating to Vendor  Hold).  (iv) For all other programs, failure to maintain all  workpapers and any other records that support the information submitted  on the cost report relating to all allocations, cost centers, cost  or statistical line items, surveys and schedules constitutes an administrative  contract violation. In the case of an administrative contract violation,  procedural guidelines and informal reconsideration and/or appeal processes  are specified in §355.111 of this title (relating to Administrative  Contract Violations).  (B) Adequate documentation. To be allowable, the relationship  between reported costs and contracted services must be clearly and  adequately documented. Adequate documentation consists of all materials  necessary to demonstrate the relationship of personnel, supplies,  and services to the provision of contracted client care or the relationship  of the central office to the individual service delivery entity level.  These materials may include, but are not limited to, accounting records,  invoices, organizational charts, functional job descriptions, other  written statements, and direct interviews with staff, as deemed necessary  by HHSC auditors to perform required tests of reasonableness, necessity,  and allowability.  (i) The minimum allowable statistical duration for  a time study upon which to base salary allocations is four weeks per  year, with one week being randomly selected from each quarter so as  to assure that the time study is representative of the various cycles  of business operations. One week is defined as only those days the  contracted provider is in operation during seven continuous days.  The time study can be performed for one continuous week during a quarter,  or it can be performed over five or seven individual days, whichever  is applicable, throughout a quarter. The time study must be a 100%  time study, accounting for 100% of the time paid the employee, including  vacation and sick leave.  (ii) To support the existence of a loan, the provider  must have available a signed copy of the loan contract which contains  the pertinent terms of the loan, such as amount, rate of interest,  method of payment, due date, and collateral. The documentation must  include an explanation for the purpose of the loan and an audit trail  must be provided showing the use of the loan proceeds. Evidence of  systematic interest and principal payments must be available and supported  by the payback schedule in the note or amortization schedule supporting  the note. Documentation must also include substantiation of any costs  associated with the securing of the loan, such as broker's fees, due  diligence fees, lender's fees, attorney's fees, etc. To document allowable  interest costs associated with related party loans, the provider is  required to maintain documentation verifying the prime interest rate  in accordance with §355.103(b)(11)(C) of this title for a similar  type of loan as of the effective date of the related party loan.  (iii) For ground transportation equipment, a mileage  log is not required if the equipment is used solely (100%) for provision  of contracted client services in accordance with program requirements  in delivering one type of contracted care. However, the contracted  provider must have a written policy that states that the ground transportation  equipment is restricted to that use and that policy must be followed.  For ground transportation equipment that is used for several purposes  (including for personal use) or multiple programs or across various  business components, mileage logs must be maintained. Personal use  includes, among other things, driving to and from a personal residence.  At a minimum, mileage logs must include for each individual trip the  date, the time of day (beginning and ending), driver, persons in the  vehicle, trip mileage (beginning, ending, and total), purpose of the  trip, and the allocation centers (the departments, programs, and/or  business entities to which the trip costs should be allocated). Flight  logs must include dates, mileage, passenger lists, and destinations,  along with any other information demonstrating the purpose of the  trips so that a relationship to contracted client care in Texas can  be determined. For the purpose of comparison to the cost of commercial  alternatives, documentation of the cost of operating and maintaining  a private aircraft includes allowable expenses relating to the lease  or depreciation of the aircraft; aircraft fuel and maintenance expenses;  aircraft insurance, taxes, and interest; pilot expenses; hangar and  other related expenses; mileage, vehicle rental or other ground transportation  expense; and airport parking fees. Documentation demonstrating the  allowable cost of commercial alternatives includes commercial airfare  ticket costs at lowest fare offered (including all discounts) and  associated expenses including mileage, vehicle rental or other ground  transportation expense; airport parking fees; and any hotel or per  diem due to necessary layovers (no scheduled flights at time of return  trip).  (iv) To substantiate the allowable cost of leasing  a luxury vehicle as defined in §355.103(b)(10)(C)(i) of this  title, the provider must obtain at the time of the lease a separate  quotation establishing the monthly lease costs for the base amount  allowable for cost-reporting purposes as specified in §355.103(b)(10)(C)(i)  of this title. Without adequate documentation to verify the allowable  lease costs of the luxury vehicle, the reported costs shall be disallowed.  (v) For adequate documentation purposes, a written  description of each cost allocation method must be maintained that  includes, at a minimum, a clear and understandable explanation of  the numerator and denominator of the allocation ratio described in  words and in numbers, as well as a written explanation of how and  to which specific business components the remaining percentage of  costs were allocated.  (vi) To substantiate the allowable cost for staff training  as defined in §355.103(b)(15)(A) of this title, the provider  must maintain a description of the training verifying that the training  pertained to contracted client care-related services or quality assurance.  At a minimum, a program brochure describing the seminar or a conference  program with description of the workshop must be maintained. The documentation  must provide a description clearly demonstrating that the seminar  or workshop provided training pertaining to contracted client care-related  services or quality assurance.  (vii) Documentation regarding the allocation of costs  related to noncontracted services, as specified in §355.102(j)(2)  of this title, must be maintained by the provider. At a minimum, the  provider must maintain written records verifying the number of units  of noncontracted services provided during the provider's fiscal year,  along with adequate documentation supporting the direct and allocated  costs associated with those noncontracted services.  (viii) Adequate documentation to substantiate legal,  accounting, and auditing fees must include, at a minimum, the amount  of time spent on the activity, a written description of the activity  performed which clearly explains to which business component the cost  should be allocated, the person performing the activity, and the hourly  billing amount of the person performing the activity. Other legal,  accounting, and auditing costs, such as photocopy costs, telephone  costs, court costs, mailing costs, expert witness costs, travel costs,  and court reporter costs, must be itemized and clearly denote to which  business component the cost should be allocated.  (ix) Providers who self insure for all or part of their  employee-related insurance costs, such as health insurance and workers'  compensation costs, must use one of the two following methods for  determining and documenting the provider's allowable costs under the  cost ceilings and any carry forward as described in §355.103(b)(13)(E)  of this title. (I) Providers may obtain and maintain each fiscal year's  documentation to establish what their premium costs would have been  had they purchased commercial insurance for total coverage. The documentation  should include, at a minimum, bids from two commercial carriers. Bids  must be obtained no less frequently than every three years.  (II) If providers choose not to obtain and maintain  commercial bids as described in subclause (I) of this clause, providers  may claim as an allowable cost the health insurance actual paid claims  incurred on behalf of the employees that does not exceed 10% of the  payroll for employees eligible for receipt of this benefit. In addition,  providers may claim as an allowable cost the workers' compensation  actual paid claims incurred on behalf of the Cont'd..."

Providers contracted in the  following programs are eligible to participate in the attendant compensation  rate enhancement: (1) Community Based Alternatives (CBA)--Assisted Living/Residential  Care (AL/RC); (2) CBA--Home and Community Support Services (HCSS); (3) Community Living Assistance and Support Services  (CLASS)--Direct Service Agency (DSA); (4) Day Activity and Health Services (DAHS); (5) Deaf-Blind with Multiple Disabilities Waiver (DBMD); (6) Home and Community-based Services (HCS); (7) Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with  Intellectual Disability or Related Conditions (ICF/IID) (""Related  Conditions"" has the same meaning as in 40 TAC §9.203 (relating  to Definitions)); (8) Primary Home Care (PHC); (9) RC; and (10) Texas Home Living (TxHmL).  (b) Definition of attendant. For the attendant compensation  rate enhancement, under this section, an attendant is the unlicensed  caregiver providing direct assistance to individuals with Activities  of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living  (IADL). (1) For the ICF/IID, DAHS, RC, and CBA AL/RC programs  and the HCS supervised living (SL)/residential support services (RSS)  and HCS and TxHmL day habilitation (DH) settings, the attendant may  perform some nonattendant functions. In such cases, the attendant  must perform attendant functions at least 80% of his or her total  time worked. Staff in these settings not providing attendant services  at least 80% of their total time worked are not considered attendants.  Time studies must be performed in accordance with §355.105(b)(2)(B)(i)  of this subchapter (relating to General Reporting and Documentation  Requirements, Methods, and Procedures) for staff in the ICF/IID, DAHS,  RC, and CBA AL/RC programs and the HCS SL/RSS and HCS and TxHmL DH  settings that are not full-time attendants but perform attendant functions  to determine if a staff member meets this 80% requirement. Failure  to perform the time studies for these staff will result in the staff  not being considered attendants. Staff performing attendant functions  in both the HCS SL/RSS and HCS and TxHmL DH settings that combine  to equal at least 80% of their total hours worked would be included  in this designation. (2) Attendants do not include the director, administrator,  assistant director, assistant administrator, clerical and secretarial  staff, professional staff, other administrative staff, licensed staff,  attendant supervisors, cooks and kitchen staff, maintenance and groundskeeping  staff, activity director, DBMD Interveners I, II or III, Qualified  Intellectual Disability Professionals (QIDPs) or assistant QIDPs,  direct care worker supervisors, direct care trainer supervisors, job  coach supervisors, foster care providers, and laundry and housekeeping  staff. In the case of HCS supported home living (SHL) and HCS Community  First Choice Personal Assistance Services/Habilitation (CFC PAS HAB),  TxHmL community support services (CSS), and TxHmL CSS/CFC PAS HAB,  PHC, CLASS, CBA--HCSS, and DBMD, staff other than attendants may deliver  attendant services and be considered an attendant if they must perform  attendant services that cannot be delivered by another attendant to  prevent a break in service. (3) An attendant also includes the following: (A) a driver who is transporting individuals in the  CBA AL/RC, DAHS, ICF/IID, and RC programs and the HCS SL/RSS and HCS  and TxHmL DH settings; (B) a medication aide in the HCS SL/RSS setting and  the CBA AL/RC, ICF/IID, and RC programs; and (C) direct care workers, direct care trainers, job  coaches, employment assistance direct care workers, and supported  employment direct care workers.  (c) Attendant compensation cost center. This cost center  will include employee compensation, contract labor costs, and personal  vehicle mileage reimbursement for attendants as defined in subsection  (b) of this section. (1) Attendant compensation is the allowable compensation  for attendants defined in §355.103(b)(1) of this title (relating  to Specifications for Allowable and Unallowable Costs) and required  to be reported as either salaries and/or wages, including payroll  taxes and workers' compensation, or employee benefits. Benefits required  by §355.103(b)(1)(A)(iii) of this title to be reported as costs  applicable to specific cost report line items, except as noted in  paragraph (3) of this subsection, are not to be included in this cost  center. For ICF/IID, attendant compensation is also subject to the  requirements detailed in §355.457 of this title (relating to  Cost Finding Methodology). For HCS and TxHmL, attendant compensation  is also subject to the requirements detailed in §355.722 of this  title (relating to Reporting Costs by Home and Community-based Services  (HCS) and Texas Home Living (TxHmL) Providers). (2) Contract labor refers to personnel for whom the  contracted provider is not responsible for the payment of payroll  taxes, such as FICA, Medicare, and federal and state unemployment  insurance, and who perform tasks routinely performed by employees  where allowed by program rules. (3) Mileage reimbursement paid to the attendant for  the use of his or her personal vehicle and which is not subject to  payroll taxes is considered compensation for this cost center. (d) Rate year. The rate year begins on the first day  of September and ends on the last day of August of the following year. (e) Open enrollment. Open enrollment begins on the  first day of July and ends on the last day of that same July preceding  the rate year for which payments are being determined. The Texas Health  and Human Services Commission (HHSC) notifies providers of open enrollment  via email sent to an authorized representative per the signature authority  designation form applicable to the provider's contract or ownership  type. If open enrollment has been postponed or cancelled, HHSC will  notify providers by email before the first day of July. Should conditions  warrant, HHSC may conduct additional enrollment periods during a rate  year.  (f) Enrollment contract amendment. (1) For CBA--HCSS and AL/RC, CLASS--DSA, DBMD, DAHS,  RC and PHC, an initial enrollment contract amendment is required from  each provider choosing to participate in the attendant compensation  rate enhancement. On the initial enrollment contract amendment, the  provider must specify for each contract a desire to participate or  not to participate and a preferred participation level. (A) For the PHC program, the participating provider  must also specify whether the attendant compensation rate enhancement  should apply to the provider’s provision of priority, nonpriority,  or both priority and nonpriority services. (B) For providers delivering both RC and CBA AL/RC  services in the same facility, participation includes both the RC  and CBA AL/RC programs. (2) For ICF/IID, HCS and TxHmL, an initial enrollment  contract amendment is required from each provider choosing to participate  in the attendant compensation rate enhancement. On the initial enrollment  contract amendment, the provider must specify for each component code  a desire to participate or not to participate and a preferred participation  level. All contracts of a component code within a specific program  must either participate at the same level or not participate. (A) For the ICF/IID program, the participating provider  must also specify the services the provider wishes to have participate  in the attendant compensation rate enhancement. Eligible services  are residential services and day habilitation services. The participating  provider must specify whether the provider wishes to participate for  residential services only, day habilitation services only or both  residential services and day habilitation services. (B) For the HCS and TxHmL programs, eligible services  are divided into three categories. The three categories of services  eligible for rate enhancement are the following: (i) non-day habilitation services: (I) SHL/CFC PAS HAB/CSS; (II) respite; (III) supported employment; and (IV) employment assistance; (ii) day habilitation services; and (iii) residential services: (I) SL; and (II) RSS. (C) The participating provider must specify which combination  of the three categories of services the attendant compensation rate  enhancement will apply to. For providers delivering services in both  the HCS and TxHmL programs, the selected categories must be the same  for their HCS and TxHmL programs, except for residential services  which are only available in the HCS program. (3) After initial enrollment, participating and nonparticipating  providers may request to modify their enrollment status during any  open enrollment period as follows: (A) a nonparticipant can request to become a participant; (B) a participant can request to become a nonparticipant;  or (C) a participant can request to change its participation  level. (4) Providers whose prior year enrollment was limited  by subsection (u) of this section who request to increase their enrollment  levels will be limited to increases of three or fewer enhancement  levels during the first open enrollment period after the limitation.  Providers that were subject to an enrollment limitation may request  to participate at any level during open enrollment beginning two years  after limitation. (5) Requests to modify a provider's enrollment status  during an open enrollment period must be received by HHSC Rate Analysis  by the last day of the open enrollment period as per subsection (e)  of this section. If the last day of open enrollment is on a weekend  day, state holiday, or national holiday, the next business day will  be considered the last day requests will be accepted. (6) For PHC, DAHS, RC, CLASS--DSA, CBA--HCSS, DBMD,  and CBA--AL/RC, providers from which HHSC Rate Analysis has not received  an acceptable request to modify their enrollment by the last day of  the open enrollment period will continue at the level of participation  in effect during the open enrollment period within available funds  until the provider notifies HHSC in accordance with subsection (x)  of this section that it no longer wishes to participate or until the  provider's enrollment is limited in accordance with subsection (u)  of this section. (7) For ICF/IID, HCS, and TxHmL, all participating  and nonparticipating providers must request to modify their enrollment  status during the 2021 enrollment period. (A) A nonparticipant can request to become a participant;  a participant can request to become a nonparticipant; and a participant  can request to change its participation level. (B) This request to modify enrollment status will constitute  a revised enrollment. Providers who have not submitted to HHSC Rate  Analysis an acceptable revised enrollment by the last day of the open  enrollment period will become non-participating providers. (C) Once the revised enrollment has been completed,  providers will continue to participate at the level of participation  in effect during the last open enrollment period within available  funds until the provider notifies HHSC in accordance with subsection  (x) of this section that it no longer wishes to participate or until  the provider's enrollment is limited in accordance with subsection  (u) of this section. (8) To be acceptable, an enrollment contract amendment  must be completed according to instructions, signed by an authorized  representative as per HHSC's signature authority designation form  applicable to the provider's contract or ownership type, and legible.  (g) New contracts. For the purposes of this section,  for each rate year a new contract is defined as a contract or component  code whose effective date is on or after the first day of the open  enrollment period, as defined in subsection (e) of this section, for  that rate year. Contracts that underwent a contract assignment or  change of ownership and new contracts that are part of an existing  component code are not considered new contracts. For purposes of this  subsection, an acceptable contract amendment is defined as a legible  enrollment contract amendment that has been completed according to  instructions, signed by an authorized representative as per HHSC's  signature authority designation form applicable to the provider's  contract or ownership type, and received by HHSC Rate Analysis within  30 days of notification to the provider that such an enrollment contract  amendment must be submitted. If the 30th day is on a weekend day,  state holiday, or national holiday, the next business day will be  considered the last day requests will be accepted. New contracts will  receive the nonparticipant attendant compensation rate as specified  in subsection (l) of this section with no enhancements. For new contracts  specifying their desire to participate in the attendant compensation  rate enhancement on an acceptable enrollment contract amendment, the  attendant compensation rate is adjusted as specified in subsection  (r) of this section, effective on the first day of the month following  receipt by HHSC of an acceptable enrollment contract amendment. If  the granting of newly requested enhancements was limited by subsection  (p)(2)(B) of this section during the most recent enrollment, enrollment  for new contracts will be subject to that same limitation. If the  most recent enrollment was Cont'd..."

The Texas Health and Human Services  Commission (HHSC) reimbursement rates for nursing facilities (NFs)  vary according to the assessed characteristics of the recipient. Rates  are determined for 34 case mix classes of service, plus a 35th, temporary  classification assigned by default when assessment data are incomplete  or in error and a 36th classification assigned by default when an  assessment is missing. (b) Reimbursement determination. HHSC applies the general  principles of cost determination as specified in §355.101 of  this title (relating to Introduction). (1) Rate Components. Under the case mix methodology,  reimbursements are comprised of five cost-related components: the  direct care staff component; the other recipient care component; the  dietary component; the general/administration component; and the fixed  capital asset component. The direct care staff component is calculated  as specified in §355.308 of this title (relating to Direct Care  Staff Rate Component). (A) The dietary rate component is constant across all  case mix classes and is calculated at the median cost (weighted by  Medicaid days of service in the rate base) in the array of projected  allowable per diem costs for all contracted nursing facilities included  in the rate base, multiplied by 1.07. (B) The general/administration rate component is constant  across all case mix classes and is calculated at the median cost (weighted  by Medicaid days of service in the rate base) in the array of projected  allowable per diem costs for all contracted nursing facilities included  in the rate base, multiplied by 1.07. (C) The fixed capital asset component is constant across  all case mix classes and is calculated as follows: (i) Determine the 80th percentile in the array of allowable  appraised property values per licensed bed, including land and improvements.  Appraised values for this purpose are determined as follows: (I) For proprietary facilities, tax exempt facilities  provided an appraisal from their local property taxing authority,  and tax exempt facilities not provided an appraisal from their local  property taxing authority because of an ""exempt"" status whose independent  appraisal is in the first year of its five-year interval as described  in §355.306(g)(2)(B)(ii) of this title (relating to Cost Finding  Methodology), allowable appraised values are determined as described  in §355.306(g) of this title (relating to Cost Finding Methodology). (II) For tax exempt facilities not provided an appraisal  from their local property taxing authority because of an ""exempt""  status whose independent appraisal is not in the first year of its  five-year interval as described in §355.306(g)(2)(B)(ii) of this  title (relating to Cost Finding Methodology), allowable appraised  values are determined by indexing the facility's allowable appraised  value as determined in §355.306(g) of this title (relating to  Cost Finding Methodology) to the median increase in appraised values  among contracted facilities in the state as a whole from the reporting  period coinciding with the first year of the facility's five-year  interval to the reporting period upon which reimbursements are to  be based. (III) Those facilities that do not report an allowable  appraised value as described in §355.306(g) of this title (relating  to Cost Finding Methodology) are not included in the array for purposes  of calculating the use fee. (ii) Project the 80th percentile of appraised property  values per bed by one-half the forecasted increase in the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) chain-type price index from the cost  reporting year to the rate year. (iii) Calculate an annual use fee per bed as the projected  80th percentile of appraised property values per bed times an annual  use rate of 14%. (iv) Calculate a per diem use fee per bed by dividing  the annual use fee per bed by annual days of service per bed at the  higher of 85% occupancy, or the statewide average occupancy rate during  the cost reporting period. (v) The use fee is limited to the lesser of the fee  as calculated in clauses (i) - (iv) of this subparagraph, or the fee  as calculated by inflating the fee from the previous rate period by  the forecasted rate of change in the PCE chain-type price index. (2) Case mix classification system. All Medicaid recipients  are classified according to the Resource Utilization Group (RUG-III)  34 group classification system, Version 5.20, index maximizing, as  established by the state and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services (CMS). Each of the case-mix groups, including the default  groups, is assigned CMS standard nursing time measurements for Registered  Nurses (RNs), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs) and aides (Medication  Aides and Certified Nurse Aides). These measurements indicate the  amount of staff time required on average to deliver care to residents  in that group. (3) Per diem rate methodology. Staff determine per  diem rate recommendations for each of the RUG-III groups and for the  default groups according to the following procedures: (A) For each RUG-III group, calculate a total LVN-equivalent  minute statistic by converting the CMS standard nursing time measurements  for RNs, LVNs and aides into Texas-specific LVN-equivalent minutes  as per §355.308(j) of this title (relating to Direct Care Staff  Rate Component) and summing the converted figures. (B) Weight the total LVN-equivalent minute statistics  from subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for each RUG-III group except  the default groups as follows and determine the statewide weighted  average total adjusted minutes: (i) For rates effective September 1, 2008, the total  LVN-equivalent minute statistics for each RUG-III group will be weighted  by the estimated statewide recipient days of service by case mix group  during the period beginning the first day of December 2007 and ending  the last day of February 2008. (ii) For rates effective September 1, 2009, the total  LVN-equivalent minute statistics for each RUG-III group will be weighted  by the estimated statewide recipient days of service by case mix group  during the period beginning the first day of September 2008 and ending  the last day of February 2009. (iii) For rates effective September 1, 2011 and thereafter,  for the other recipient care rate component, the total LVN-equivalent  minute statistics for each RUG-III group will be weighted by the estimated  statewide recipient days of service by case mix group during the cost  reporting period covered by the rate base. For the direct care rate  component, the total LVN-equivalent minute statistics for each RUG-III  group will be weighted by the estimated statewide recipient days of  service by case mix group during the period beginning the first day  of September, 2008 and ending the last day of February, 2009. (C) Determine the standardized statewide case mix index  for each of the RUG-III groups by dividing each of the total LVN-equivalent  minute statistics described under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  by the statewide weighted average total adjusted minutes described  under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (D) The other recipient care rate component varies  according to case mix class of service and is calculated as follows.  Adjust the raw sum of other recipient care costs in all nursing facilities  included in the rate base in order to account for disallowed costs  and inflation, as specified in §355.306 of this title (relating  to Cost Finding Methodology). Then divide the adjusted total by the  sum of recipient days of service in all facilities in the current  rate base. Multiply the resulting weighted, average per diem cost  of other recipient care by 1.07. The result is the average other recipient  care rate component. To calculate the other recipient care per diem  rate component for each of the RUG-III case mix groups and for the  default groups, multiply each of the standardized statewide case mix  indexes from subparagraph (C) of this paragraph by the average other  recipient care rate component. (E) Total case mix per diem rates vary according to  case mix class of service and according to participant status in Direct  Care Staff Rate enhancements described in §355.308 of this title  (relating to Direct Care Staff Rate Component). (i) For each participating facility, for each of the  RUG-III case mix groups and for the default groups, the recommended  total per diem rate is the sum of the following five rate components: (I) the dietary rate component from paragraph (1)(A)  of this subsection; (II) the general/administration rate component from  paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection; (III) the fixed capital asset use fee component from  paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection; (IV) the case mix group's other recipient care per  diem rate component by case mix group from subparagraph (D) of this  paragraph; and (V) the case mix group's total direct care staff rate  component for that participating facility as determined in §355.308(l)  of this title (relating to Direct Care Staff Rate Component). (ii) For nonparticipating facilities, for each of the  RUG-III case mix groups and for the default groups, the recommended  total per diem rate is the sum of the following five rate components: (I) the dietary rate component from paragraph (1)(A)  of this subsection; (II) the general/administration rate component from  paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection; (III) the fixed capital asset use fee component from  paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection; (IV) the case mix group's other recipient care per  diem rate component by case mix group from subparagraph (D) of this  paragraph; and (V) the case mix group's total direct care staff base  rate component as determined in §355.308(k) of this title (relating  to Direct Care Staff Rate Component). (F) Qualifying ventilator-dependent residents may receive  a supplement to the per diem rate specified in subparagraph (E) of  this paragraph. (i) To qualify for supplemental reimbursement, a resident  must require artificial ventilation for at least six consecutive hours  daily and the use must be prescribed by a licensed physician. (ii) A ventilator-dependent resource differential case  mix index for the other recipient care rate component is calculated  by subtracting the standardized statewide case mix index for the SE1  RUG-III case mix group from subparagraph (C) of this paragraph from  3.61. A ventilator-dependent resource differential case mix index  for the direct care staff base rate component is calculated by dividing  the resource differential case mix index for the other recipient care  rate component by 0.9908. (iii) The per diem rate supplement is calculated by  multiplying the resource differential case mix index for the other  recipient care rate component times the per diem average other recipient  care rate component, as described in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph  and multiplying the resource differential case mix index for the direct  care staff base rate component by the average direct care staff base  rate component as described in §355.308(k) of this title (relating  to Direct Care Staff Rate) and summing the products. (iv) The supplemental reimbursement for residents requiring  continuous artificial ventilation is 100% of the per diem ventilator  rate supplement. (v) The supplemental reimbursement for residents not  requiring continuous artificial ventilation daily but requiring artificial  ventilation for at least six consecutive hours daily is 40% of the  per diem ventilator rate supplement. (G) Qualifying children with tracheostomies requiring  daily care may receive a supplement to the per diem rate specified  in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. (i) To qualify for supplemental reimbursement, a resident  must be less than 22 years of age; require daily cleansing, dressing,  and suctioning of a tracheostomy; and be unable to do self care. The  daily care of the tracheostomy must be prescribed by a licensed physician. (ii) The supplemental reimbursement for children receiving  daily tracheostomy care is 60% of the per diem ventilator rate supplement  as specified in subparagraph (F) of this paragraph. (H) Children with qualifying conditions as specified  in subparagraphs (F) and (G) of this paragraph may receive only one  of the supplemental reimbursements. Therefore, children with tracheostomies  who are also ventilator-dependent are not eligible to receive both  supplemental reimbursements.  (c) Special reimbursement class. HHSC may define special  reimbursement classes, including experimental reimbursement classes  of service to be used in research and demonstration projects on new  reimbursement methods and reimbursement classes of service, to address  the cost differences of a select group of recipients. Special classes  may be implemented on a statewide basis, may be limited to a specific  region of the state, or may be limited to a selected group of providers.  Reimbursement for the Pediatric Care Facility Class is calculated  as specified in §355.316 of this subchapter (relating to Reimbursement  Methodology for Pediatric Care Facilities).  (d) Nurse aide training and competency evaluation costs. Cont'd..."

This cost center  will include compensation for employee and contract labor Registered  Nurses (RNs), including Directors of Nursing (DONs) and Assistant  Directors of Nursing (ADONs); Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), including  DONs and ADONs; medication aides; and nurse aides performing nursing-related  duties for Medicaid contracted beds.  (1) Compensation to be included for these employee  staff types is the allowable compensation defined in §355.103(b)(1)  of this title (relating to Specifications for Allowable and Unallowable  Costs) that is reported as either salaries and/or wages (including  payroll taxes and workers' compensation) or employee benefits. Benefits  required by §355.103(b)(1)(A)(iii) of this title to be reported  as costs applicable to specific cost report line items are not to  be included in this cost center.  (2) Direct care staff who also have administrative  duties not related to nursing must properly direct charge their compensation  to each type of function performed based upon daily time sheets maintained  throughout the entire reporting period.  (3) Nurse aides must meet the qualifications enumerated  under 40 TAC §19.1903 (relating to Required Training of Nurse  Aides) to be included in this cost center. Nurse aides include certified  nurse aides and nurse aides in training as per 40 TAC §94.3(k)  (relating to Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluation Program  (NATCEP) Requirements).  (4) Contract labor refers to personnel for whom the  contracted provider is not responsible for the payment of payroll  taxes (such as FICA, Medicare, and federal and state unemployment  insurance) and who perform tasks routinely performed by employees.  Allowable contract labor costs are defined in §355.103(b)(3)  of this title.  (5) For facilities receiving supplemental reimbursement  for children with tracheostomies requiring daily care as described  in §355.307(b)(3)(F) of this title (relating to Reimbursement  Setting Methodology), staff required by 40 TAC §19.901(14)(C)(iii)  (relating to Quality of Care) performing nursing-related duties for  Medicaid contracted beds are included in the direct care staff cost  center.  (6) For facilities receiving supplemental reimbursement  for qualifying ventilator-dependent residents as described in §355.307(b)(3)(E)  of this title, Registered Respiratory Therapists and Certified Respiratory  Therapy Technicians are included in the direct care staff cost center.  (7) Nursing facility administrators and assistant administrators  are not included in the direct care staff cost center.  (8) Staff members performing more than one function  in a facility without a differential in pay between functions are  categorized at the highest level of licensure or certification they  possess. If this highest level of licensure or certification is not  that of an RN, LVN, medication aide, or certified nurse aide, the  staff member is not to be included in the direct care staff cost center  but rather in the cost center where staff members with that licensure  or certification status are typically reported.  (9) Paid feeding assistants are not included in the  direct care staff cost center and are not to be counted toward the  staffing requirements described in subsection (j) of this section.  Paid feeding assistants are intended to supplement certified nurse  aides, not to be a substitute for certified or licensed nursing staff. (b) Rate year. The standard rate year begins on the  first day of September and ends on the last day of August of the following  year.  (c) Open enrollment. Open enrollment for the enhanced  direct care staff rates will begin on the first day of July and end  on the last day of that same July preceding the rate year for which  payments are being determined. HHSC notifies providers of open enrollment  by electronic mail (e-mail) to an authorized representative per the  signature authority designation form applicable to the provider's  contract or ownership type. If open enrollment has been postponed  or cancelled, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)  will notify providers by e-mail prior to the first day of July. Should  conditions warrant, HHSC may conduct additional enrollment periods  during a rate year.  (d) Enrollment contract amendment. An initial enrollment  contract amendment is required from each facility choosing to participate  in the enhanced direct care staff rate. Participating and nonparticipating  facilities may request to modify their enrollment status (i.e., a  nonparticipant can request to become a participant, a participant  can request to become a nonparticipant, a participant can request  to change its enhancement level) during any open enrollment period.  Nonparticipants and participants requesting to increase their enrollment  levels will be limited to requesting increases of three or fewer enhancement  levels during any single open enrollment period unless such limits  are waived by HHSC. Requests to modify a facility's enrollment status  during an open enrollment period must be received by HHSC Rate Analysis  by the last day of the open enrollment period as per subsection (c)  of this section. If the last day of the open enrollment period falls  on a weekend, a national holiday, or a state holiday, then the first  business day following the last day of the open enrollment period  is the final day the receipt of the enrollment contract amendment  will be accepted. An enrollment contract amendment that is not received  by the stated deadline will not be accepted. A facility from which  HHSC Rate Analysis has not received an acceptable request to modify  their enrollment by the last day of the open enrollment period will  continue at the level of participation in effect during the open enrollment  period within available funds until the facility notifies HHSC in  accordance with subsection (r) of this section that it no longer wishes  to participate or until the facility's enrollment is limited in accordance  with subsection (i) of this section. If HHSC determines that funds  are not available to continue participation at the level of participation  in effect during the open enrollment period, facilities will be notified  as per subsection (ee) of this section. To be acceptable, an enrollment  contract amendment must be completed according to instructions, signed  by an authorized representative as per the Texas Department of Aging  and Disabilities Services (DADS) signature authority designation form  applicable to the provider's contract or ownership type, and be legible.  (e) New facilities. For purposes of this section, for  each rate year a new facility is defined as a facility delivering  its first day of service to a Medicaid recipient after the first day  of the open enrollment period, as defined in subsection (c) of this  section, for that rate year. Facilities that underwent an ownership  change are not considered new facilities. For purposes of this subsection,  an acceptable enrollment contract amendment is defined as a legible  enrollment contract amendment that has been completed according to  instructions, signed by an authorized representative as per the DADS  signature authority designation form applicable to the provider's  contract or ownership type, and received by HHSC within 30 days of  the notification to the facility by HHSC that such an enrollment contract  amendment must be submitted. New facilities will receive the direct  care staff base rate as determined in subsection (k) of this section  with no enhancements. For new facilities specifying their desire to  participate on an acceptable enrollment contract amendment, the direct  care staff rate is adjusted as specified in subsection (l) of this  section, effective on the first day of the month following receipt  by HHSC of the acceptable enrollment contract amendment. If the granting  of newly requested enhancements was limited as per subsection (j)(3)  of this section during the most recent enrollment, enrollment for  new facilities will be subject to that same limitation.  (f) Staffing and Compensation Report submittal requirements.  (1) Annual Staffing and Compensation Report. For services  delivered on or before August 31, 2009, providers must file Staffing  and Compensation Reports as follows. All participating facilities  will provide HHSC, in a method specified by HHSC, an Annual Staffing  and Compensation Report reflecting the activities of the facility  while delivering contracted services from the first day of the rate  year through the last day of the rate year. This report will be used  as the basis for determining compliance with the staffing requirements  and recoupment amounts as described in subsection (n) of this section,  and as the basis for determining the spending requirements and recoupment  amounts as described in subsection (o) of this section. Participating  facilities failing to submit an acceptable Annual Staffing and Compensation  Report within 60 days of the end of the rate year will be placed on  vendor hold until such time as an acceptable report is received and  processed by HHSC.  (A) When a participating facility changes ownership,  the prior owner must submit a Staffing and Compensation Report covering  the period from the beginning of the rate year to the date recognized  by HHSC or its designee as the ownership-change effective date. This  report will be used as the basis for determining any recoupment amounts  as described in subsections (n) and (o) of this section. The new owner  will be required to submit a Staffing and Compensation Report covering  the period from the day after the date recognized by HHSC or its designee  as the ownership-change effective date to the end of the rate year.  (B) Participating facilities whose contracts are terminated  either voluntarily or involuntarily must submit a Staffing and Compensation  Report covering the period from the beginning of the rate year to  the date recognized by HHSC or its designee as the contract termination  date. This report will be used as the basis for determining any recoupment  amounts as described in subsections (n) and (o) of this section.  (C) Participating facilities who voluntarily withdraw  from participation as per subsection (r) of this section must submit  a Staffing and Compensation Report within 60 days of the date of withdrawal  as determined by HHSC, covering the period from the beginning of the  rate year to the date of withdrawal as determined by HHSC. This report  will be used as the basis for determining any recoupment amounts as  described in subsections (n) and (o) of this section. (D) Participating facilities whose cost report year  coincides with the state of Texas fiscal year as per §355.105(b)(5)  of this title (relating to General Reporting and Documentation Requirements,  Methods, and Procedures) are exempt from the requirement to submit  a separate Annual Staffing and Compensation Report. For these facilities,  their cost report will be considered their Annual Staffing and Compensation  Report.  (2) For services delivered on September 1, 2009, and  thereafter, cost reports as described in §355.105(b) of this  title will replace the Staffing and Compensation Report with the following  exceptions:  (A) For services delivered from September 1, 2009,  to August 31, 2010, participating facilities may be required to submit  Transition Staffing and Compensation Reports in addition to required  cost reports. The Transition Staffing and Compensation Report reporting  period will include those days in calendar years 2009 and 2010 not  included in either the 2009 Staffing and Compensation report or the  facility's 2010 cost report.  (B) When a participating facility changes ownership,  the prior owner must submit a Staffing and Compensation Report covering  the period from the beginning of the facility's cost reporting period  to the date recognized by HHSC or its designee as the ownership-change  effective date. This report will be used as the basis for determining  any recoupment amounts as described in subsections (n) and (o) of  this section. The new owner will be required to submit a cost report  covering the period from the day after the date recognized by HHSC  or its designee as the ownership-change effective date to the end  of the facility's fiscal year.  (C) Participating facilities whose contracts are terminated  either voluntarily or involuntarily must submit a Staffing and Compensation  Report covering the period from the beginning of the facility's cost  reporting period to the date recognized by HHSC or its designee as  the contract termination date. This report will be used as the basis  for determining any recoupment amounts as described in subsections  (n) and (o) of this section.  (D) Participating facilities who voluntarily withdraw  from participation as per subsection (r) of this section must submit  a Staffing and Compensation Report within 60 days of the date of withdrawal  as determined by HHSC, covering the period from the beginning of the  facility's cost reporting period to the date of withdrawal as determined  by HHSC. This report will be used as the basis for determining any  recoupment amounts as described in subsections (n) and (o) of this  section. These facilities must still submit a cost report covering  the entire cost reporting period. The cost report will not be used  for determining any recoupment amounts.  (E) For new facilities as defined in subsection (e)  of this section, the cost reporting period will begin with the effective  date of participation in enhancement. (F) Existing facilities which become participants in  the enhancement as a result of the open enrollment process described  in subsection (c) of this section on any day other than the first  day of their fiscal year are required to submit a Staffing and Compensation  Report with a reporting period that begins on their first day of participation  in the enhancement and ends on the last day of the facility's fiscal  year. This report will be used as the basis for determining any recoupment  amounts as described in subsections (n) and (o) of Cont'd..."

Notwithstanding other provisions  of this subchapter and subject to the availability of funds, supplemental  payments are available under this section for nursing facility services  provided by eligible non-state government-owned nursing facilities. (b) Definitions. When used in this section, the following  definitions apply: (1) Adjudicated claim--A claim for a covered Medicaid  nursing facility service that has been paid by HHSC. (2) HHSC--The Texas Health and Human Services Commission  or its designee. (3) Intergovernmental transfer (IGT)--A transfer of  public funds from a non-state governmental entity to HHSC. (4) Medicaid supplemental payment limit--The maximum  supplemental payment available to a participating non-state government-owned  nursing facility for a specific quarterly calculation period as calculated  in subsection (f) of this section. (5) Medicaid supplemental payment limit calculation  period--The federal fiscal quarter determined by HHSC for which supplemental  payment amounts are calculated based on adjudicated claims for days  of service provided in the same quarter in the prior federal fiscal  year. (6) Non-state governmental entity--A hospital authority,  hospital district, healthcare district, city, or county. (7) Non-state government-owned nursing facility--A  nursing facility where a non-state governmental entity holds the license  and is party to the facility's Medicaid contract. (8) Public funds--Funds derived from taxes, assessments,  levies, investments, and other public revenues within the sole and  unrestricted control of a non-state governmental entity that holds  the license and is party to the Medicaid contract of the nursing facility  identified in subsection (c) of this section. Public funds do not  include gifts, grants, trusts, or donations, the use of which is conditioned  on supplying a benefit solely to the donor or grantor of the funds. (9) Upper payment limit--A reasonable estimate of the  amount that would be paid for the services furnished by a non-state  government-owned nursing facility under Medicare payment principles,  as calculated in subsection (f) of this section. (10) Upper payment limit calculation period--The federal  fiscal quarter one year prior to the Medicaid supplemental payment  limit calculation period. For example, October 1 - December 31, 2011,  is the upper payment limit calculation period for the October 1 -  December 31, 2012, Medicaid supplemental payment limit calculation  period. (c) Eligible nursing facilities. (1) Supplemental payments are available under this  section to all non-state government-owned nursing facilities that  comply with the requirements described in subsection (d) of this section. (2) A nursing facility participating in this supplemental  payment program must notify the HHSC Rate Analysis Department of changes  in ownership that may affect the nursing facility's continued eligibility  within 30 days after such change. (3) A nursing facility that has not received a payment  under this supplemental payment program for four consecutive quarters  is ineligible for future supplemental payments unless the nursing  facility applies again for the supplemental payment program in accordance  with subsection (d) of this section. (d) Required application. Before a non-state government-owned  nursing facility may receive supplemental payments under this section,  the appropriate non-state governmental entity must certify certain  facts, representations, and assurances regarding program requirements. (1) The appropriate non-state governmental entity must  certify the following facts on a form prescribed by HHSC before the  first day of the next scheduled Medicaid supplemental payment limit  calculation period in order for the nursing facility to receive a  supplemental payment for that period: (A) That it is a non-state government-owned nursing  facility where a non-state governmental entity holds the license and  is party to the facility's Medicaid contract. (B) That all funds transferred to HHSC via IGT for  use as the state share of supplemental payments are public funds. (C) That no part of any supplemental payment paid to  the nursing facility under this section will be used to pay a contingent  fee, consulting fee, or legal fee associated with the nursing facility's  receipt of the supplemental funds. (D) That the person signing the certification on behalf  of the nursing facility is legally authorized to bind the nursing  facility and to certify the matters described in the application. (2) The nursing facility is eligible for supplemental  payments for Medicaid supplemental payment limit calculation periods  that begin after HHSC receives completed application forms from the  appropriate non-state governmental entity. A non-state governmental  entity that has submitted a change of ownership (CHOW) application  to the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) may submit  a provisional application for participation in the supplemental payment  program. If the CHOW is finalized by DADS within six months of the  submission of the provisional application for participation, the facility  will be eligible for payments beginning on the effective date of the  CHOW. If the CHOW is not finalized by DADS within six months of the  submission of the provisional application for participation, the provisional  application is denied and the facility will not be eligible for payments  until the first day of the Medicaid supplemental payment limit calculation  period that begins after the submission of a new application for participation. (e) Source of funding. (1) State funding for supplemental payments authorized  under this section is limited to and obtained through IGTs of public  funds from the non-state governmental entity that holds the license  and is party to the Medicaid contract of the nursing facility identified  in subsection (c) of this section. (2) An IGT that is not received by the date specified  by HHSC may not be accepted. In such a situation, the IGT will be  returned to the non-state governmental entity and the NF will not  be eligible to receive a supplemental payment. (f) Medicaid supplemental payment limits. A quarterly  supplemental payment amount for each non-state government owned nursing  facility is calculated using the most recent reliable data available  at the time the calculation is made by taking the difference between  the upper payment limit from paragraph (1) of this subsection and  the Medicaid payment from paragraph (2) of this subsection: (1) The upper payment limit for each non-state government-owned  nursing facility will be calculated based on Medicare payment principles  and in accordance with the Medicaid upper payment limit provisions  codified at Title 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §447.272.  A total Medicare-equivalent payment is determined for each non-state  government-owned facility as the sum of the products of Medicaid days  of service by Resource Utilization Group (RUG) for adjudicated Medicaid  days of service provided by the facility during the upper payment  limit calculation period multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for  that RUG that will be in effect during the associated Medicaid supplemental  payment limit calculation period. If the Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Services has not adopted Medicare RUG rates for the Medicaid supplemental  payment limit calculation period at the time the calculation is performed,  the Medicaid days of service by RUG will be multiplied by the Medicare  payment rate for that RUG in effect on the last day of the upper payment  limit calculation period. (2) The Medicaid payment for each non-state government-owned  nursing facility prior to the supplemental payment will be the sum  of the following components calculated for that nursing facility from  data derived from upper payment limit calculation period: (A) The sum of Medicaid RUG payments for all adjudicated  Medicaid days of service provided by the facility during the upper  payment limit calculation period adjusted to reflect any changes in  Medicaid RUG rates between the upper payment limit calculation period  and the Medicaid supplemental payment limit calculation period; and (B) Medicaid payments for pharmacy services as defined  in 40 TAC Chapter 19, Subchapter P (relating to Pharmacy Services),  specialized services as defined in 40 TAC §19.1303 (relating  to Specialized Services in Medicaid-certified Facilities), customized  equipment as defined in 40 TAC §19.2614 (relating to Customized  Power Wheelchairs) and emergency dental services as defined in 40  TAC §19.1402 (relating to Medicaid-certified Nursing Facility  Emergency Dental Services), not included in the Medicaid nursing facility  rate in effect during the upper payment limit calculation period. (i) Medicaid payments for pharmacy services are based  on Texas specific pharmacy payment and rebate data for Texas Medicaid  nursing facility residents during the upper payment limit calculation  period. (ii) Medicaid payments for emergency dental, customized  equipment and specialized services are based on Texas specific emergency  dental, customized equipment and specialized services payment data  for Texas Medicaid nursing facility residents during the upper payment  limit calculation period. (3) Changes of ownership. (A) For a nursing facility that changed ownership prior  to the first day of the Medicaid supplemental payment limit calculation  period but after the first day of the upper payment limit calculation  period, the data used for the calculations described in paragraphs  (1) and (2) of this subsection will include data from the facility  for the entire upper payment limit calculation period including data  relating to payments for days of service provided under the prior  owner. The inclusion of data relating to payments for days of service  provided under the prior owner will ensure that the calculation of  the supplemental payment amount for the Medicaid supplemental payment  limit calculation period reflects a full quarter of services. (B) For a nursing facility that changes ownership on  or after the first day of the Medicaid supplemental payment limit  calculation period, the data used for the calculations described in  paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection will include data from the  facility for the entire upper payment limit calculation period relating  to payments for days of service provided under the prior owner, pro-rated  to reflect only the number of calendar days during the Medicaid supplemental  payment limit calculation period that the facility is owned by the  new owner. (g) Payment frequency. HHSC will distribute supplemental  payments to participating non-state government-owned nursing facilities  on a quarterly basis subsequent to the Medicaid supplemental payment  limit calculation period. (h) Supplemental payment methodology. (1) HHSC will give notice of the non-state government-owned  nursing facility quarterly Medicaid supplemental payment limits determined  in subsection (f) of this section, the maximum IGT amount that can  be provided for each participating nursing facility based on the Federal  Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) in place at the time notice is  given, and the deadline for completing the transfer. (2) The amount of the supplemental payment to the nursing  facility will be calculated in proportion to the amount transferred  by the non-state governmental entity. (A) For governmental entities that own a single nursing  facility: (i) If the non-state governmental entity transfers  the maximum IGT described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the  nursing facility will receive the Medicaid supplemental payment limit  amount calculated for it in subsection (f) of this section. (ii) If the non-state governmental entity transfers  less than the maximum IGT described in paragraph (1) of this subsection,  the nursing facility will receive a supplemental payment that is proportionate  to the percentage of the maximum IGT that was actually transferred. (B) For governmental entities that own multiple nursing  facilities: (i) If the non-state governmental entity transfers  the maximum IGT described in paragraph (1) of this subsection for  all of the nursing facilities it owns, each of the nursing facilities  will receive the Medicaid supplemental payment limit amount calculated  for it in subsection (f) of this section. (ii) If the non-state governmental entity transfers  less than the maximum IGT described in paragraph (1) of this subsection  for all of the nursing facilities it owns, each of the nursing facilities  will receive a proportion of the Medicaid supplemental payment limit  amount calculated for it in subsection (f) of this section based on  the proportion of the total maximum IGT for all of the nursing facilities  owned by the non-state governmental entity that was actually transferred. (C) Supplemental payments to remaining non-state government-owned  nursing facilities will not be increased due to the failure of a non-state  governmental entity to transfer the maximum IGT described in paragraph  (1) of this subsection.

There are two types of facilities  for purposes of rate setting: state-operated and non-state operated.  Facilities are further divided into classes that are determined by  the size of the facility.  (b) Classes of non-state operated facilities. There  is a separate set of reimbursement rates for each class of non-state  operated facilities, which are as follows.  (1) Large facility--A facility with a Medicaid certified  capacity of 14 or more as of the first day of the full month immediately  preceding a rate's effective date or, if certified for the first time  after a rate's effective date, as of the date of initial certification.  (2) Medium facility--A facility with a Medicaid certified  capacity of nine through 13 as of the first day of the full month  immediately preceding a rate's effective date or, if certified for  the first time after a rate's effective date, as of the date of initial  certification.  (3) Small facility--A facility with a Medicaid certified  capacity of eight or fewer as of the first day of the full month immediately  preceding a rate's effective date or, if certified for the first time  after a rate's effective date, as of the date of initial certification.  (c) Classes of state-operated facilities. There is  a separate interim rate for each class of state-operated facilities,  which are as follows:  (1) Large facility--A facility with a Medicaid certified  capacity of 17 or more as of the first day of the full month immediately  preceding a rate's effective date or, if certified for the first time  after a rate's effective date, as of the date of initial certification.  (2) Small facility--A facility with a Medicaid certified  capacity of 16 or less as of the first day of the full month immediately  preceding a rate's effective date or, if certified for the first time  after a rate's effective date, as of the date of initial certification.  (d) Reimbursement rate determination for non-state  operated facilities. HHSC will adopt the reimbursement rates for non-state  operated facilities in accordance with §355.101 of this title  (relating to Introduction) and this subchapter.  (1) Reimbursement rates combine residential and day  program services, i.e., payment for the full 24 hours of daily service.  (2) Reimbursement rates are differentiated based on  the level of need (LON) of the individual receiving the service. The  levels of need are intermittent, limited, extensive, pervasive, and  pervasive plus.  (3) The recommended modeled rates are based on cost  components deemed appropriate for economically and efficiently operated  services. The determination of these components is based on cost reports  submitted by Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with an  Intellectual Disability or Related Conditions (ICF/IID) providers.  (4) Direct service workers cost area. This cost area  includes direct service workers' salaries and wages, benefits, and  mileage reimbursement expenses. The reimbursement rate for this cost  area is calculated as specified in §355.112 of this title (relating  to Attendant Compensation Rate Enhancement).  (5) Direct care trainers and job coaches cost area.  This cost area includes direct care trainers' and job coaches' salaries  and wages, benefits, and mileage reimbursement expenses. The reimbursement  rate for this cost area is calculated as specified in §355.112  of this title.  (6) Add-on reimbursement rate. There is an available  add-on reimbursement rate, in addition to the daily reimbursement  rate, for certain individuals.  (A) The add-on is based on the Resource Utilization  Group (RUG-III) 34 group classification system as described in §355.307  of this title (relating to Reimbursement Setting Methodology).  (B) There are three add-on groupings based on certain  RUG-III 34 classification groups and the assessed Activities of Daily  Living (ADL) score.  (i) Group 1 includes Extensive Services 3 (SE3), Extensive  Services 2 (SE2), and Rehabilitation with ADL score of 17-18 (RAD).  (ii) Group 2 includes Rehabilitation with ADL score  of 14-16 (RAC), Rehabilitation with ADL score of 10-13 (RAB), Extensive  Services 1 (SE1), Special Care with ADL score of 17-18 (SSC), Special  Care with ADL score of 15-16 (SSB), and Special Care with ADL score  of 4-14 (SSA).  (iii) Group 3 includes Rehabilitation with ADL score  of 4-9 (RAA), Clinically Complex with Depression and ADL score of  17-18 (CC2), Clinically Complex with ADL score of 17-18 (CC1), Clinically  Complex with Depression and ADL score of 12-16 (CB2), Clinically Complex  and ADL score of 12-16 (CB1), Clinically Complex with Depression and  ADL score of 4-11 (CA2), and Clinically Complex and ADL score of 4-11  (CA1).  (C) An individual must meet the following criteria  to be eligible to receive the add-on rate:  (i) be assigned a RUG-III 34 classification in Group  1, Group 2, or Group 3;  (ii) be a resident of a large state-operated facility  for at least six months immediately prior to referral or a resident  of a Medicaid-certified nursing facility immediately prior to referral;  and  (iii) for residents of a large state-operated facility  only, have a LON which includes a medical LON increase as described  in 40 TAC §9.241 (relating to Level of Need Criteria), but not  be assessed a LON of pervasive plus.  (D) The add-on for each Group is determined based on  data and costs from the most recent nursing facility cost reports  accepted by HHSC.  (i) For each Group, compute the median direct care  staff per diem base rate component for all facilities as specified  in §355.308 of this title (relating to Direct Care Staff Rate  Component); and  (ii) Subtract the average nursing portion of the current  recommended modeled rates as specified in subsection (d)(3) of this  section.  (e) Reimbursement determination for state-operated  facilities. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection  and subsection (f) of this section, state-operated facilities are  reimbursed an interim rate with a settlement conducted in accordance  with paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. HHSC will adopt the interim  reimbursement rates for state-operated facilities in accordance with §355.101  of this title and this subchapter.  (1) State-operated facilities certified prior to January  1, 2001, will be reimbursed using an interim reimbursement rate and  settlement process.  (A) Interim reimbursement rates for state-operated  facilities are based on the most recent cost report accepted by HHSC.  (B) Settlement is conducted each state fiscal year  by class of facility. If there is a difference between allowable costs  and the reimbursement paid under the interim rate, including applied  income, for a state fiscal year, federal funds to the state will be  adjusted based on that difference.  (2) A state-operated facility certified on or after  January 1, 2001, will be reimbursed using a pro forma rate determined  in accordance with §355.101(c)(2)(B) and §355.105(h) of  this title (relating to Introduction and General Reporting and Documentation  Requirements, Methods and Procedures). A facility will be reimbursed  under the pro forma rate methodology until HHSC receives an acceptable  cost report which includes at least 12 months of the facility's cost  data and is available to be included in the annual interim rate determination  process.  (f) HHSC may define experimental classes of service  to be used in research and demonstration projects on new reimbursement  methods. Demonstration or pilot projects based on experimental classes  may be implemented on a statewide basis or may be limited to a specific  region of the state or to a selected group of providers. Reimbursement  for an experimental class is not implemented, however, unless HHSC  and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approve the  experimental methodology.  (g) Cost Reporting.  (1) Providers must follow the cost-reporting guidelines  as specified in §355.105 of this title.  (2) Providers must follow the guidelines in determining  whether a cost is allowable or unallowable as specified in §355.102  and §355.103 of this title (relating to General Principles of  Allowable and Unallowable Costs, and Specifications for Allowable  and Unallowable Costs).  (3) Revenues must be reported on the cost report in  accordance with §355.104 of this title (relating to Revenues).  (h) Adjusting costs. Each provider's total reported  allowable costs, excluding depreciation and mortgage interest, are  projected from the historical cost-reporting period to the prospective  reimbursement period as described in §355.108 of this title (relating  to Determination of Inflation Indices). HHSC may adjust reimbursement  if new legislation, regulations, or economic factors affect costs,  according to §355.109 of this title (relating to Adjusting Reimbursement  When New Legislation, Regulations, or Economic Factors Affect Costs).  (i) Field Audit and Desk Review. Desk reviews or field  audits are performed on cost reports for all contracted providers.  The frequency and nature of the field audits are determined by HHSC  to ensure the fiscal integrity of the program. Desk reviews and field  audits will be conducted in accordance with §355.106 of this  title (relating to Basic Objectives and Criteria for Audit and Desk  Review of Cost Reports), and providers will be notified of the results  of a desk review or a field audit in accordance with §355.107  of this title (relating to Notification of Exclusions and Adjustments).  Providers may request an informal review and, if necessary, an administrative  hearing to dispute an action taken under §355.110 of this title  (relating to Informal Reviews and Formal Appeals).  (j) Total Medicaid Spending Requirement. Effective  for costs and revenues accrued on or after September 1, 2015, through  August 31, 2017, all non-state operated ICF/IID providers are required  to spend at least 90 percent of revenues received through the ICF/IID  daily Medicaid payment rates on Medicaid allowable costs under the  ICF/IID program.  (1) Compliance with the total Medicaid spending requirement  will be determined in the aggregate for all component codes controlled  by the same entity across the ICF/IID, Home and Community-based Services  (HCS), and Texas Home Living (TxHmL) programs within the same cost  report year.  (2) Compliance with the spending requirement is determined  on an annual basis using cost reports as described in Chapter 355,  Subchapter A, of this title (relating to Cost Determination Process)  and this subchapter.  (A) When a provider changes ownership through a contract  assignment, the prior owner must submit a report covering the period  from the beginning of the provider's fiscal year to the effective  date of the contract assignment as determined by HHSC or its designee.  This report is used as the basis for determining compliance with the  spending requirement.  (B) Providers whose contracts are terminated voluntarily  or involuntarily must submit a report covering the period from the  beginning of the provider's fiscal year to the date recognized by  HHSC or its designee as the contract termination date. This report  is used as the basis for determining compliance with the spending  requirement.  (C) When part of a cost reporting period is subject  to spending accountability and part is not subject to spending accountability,  a provider may choose to have HHSC divide their costs for the entire  cost reporting period between the part of the period subject to spending  accountability and the part of the period not subject to spending  accountability on a pro-rata basis (i.e., pro-rata allocation). For  example, if six months of a twelve month cost reporting period are  subject to spending accountability, HHSC would divide the provider's  costs for the entire cost reporting period by two to determine the  costs subject to spending accountability. Providers who do not choose  to have HHSC divide their costs on a pro-rata basis must report their  costs for the period subject to spending accountability separately  from their costs for the period not subject to spending accountability  (i.e., direct reporting). Once a provider indicates to HHSC their  choice between a pro-rata allocation and direct reporting for a specific  cost reporting period, that choice is irrevocable for that cost reporting  period.  (3) Allowable costs are those described in Chapter  355, Subchapter A, and this subchapter.  (4) The total Medicaid revenue for an ICF/IID provider  participating in the attendant compensation rate enhancement is offset  by any recoupment made under §355.112(s) of this title prior  to determining compliance with the spending requirement.  (5) Providers who fail to meet the 90 percent spending  requirement are subject to a recoupment of the difference between  the 90 percent spending requirement and their actual Medicaid allowable  ICF/IID costs. Recoupments for each rate period under this subsection  are limited to the difference between the provider's Medicaid revenues  for services provided at the rates subject to spending accountability  and what the provider's Medicaid revenues would have been for services  provided at the Medicaid rates in effect on August 31, 2015.

The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) applies the general principles of cost determination as specified in §355.101 of this title (relating to Introduction). (b) Additional requirements. In addition to the requirements of §355.102 and §355.103 of this title (relating to General Principles of Allowable and Unallowable Costs, and Specifications for Allowable and Unallowable Costs), the following apply to costs for the intermediate care facilities for persons with mental retardation (ICF/MR) program. (1) Attendant service costs. Attendant service costs are defined in §355.112 of this title (relating to Attendant Compensation Rate Enhancement). (2) Provider responsibilities. The provider is responsible for submission of the cost report to HHSC, and payment of amounts owed in accordance with subsection (c) of this section for services delivered on or before August 31, 2009, and payment of amounts owed in accordance with §355.112 of this title for services delivered on or after September 1, 2010, regardless of whether the provider contracts with another entity for the management or operation of the ICF/MR. (A) If the provider contracts with another entity for the management or operation of the ICF/MR, the provider must report the specific costs of that entity as required in the cost report instructions and not the amount for which the provider is contracting for the entity's services. (B) For staff whose duties include work other than the provision of attendant services for the provider, time spent providing attendant services and associated expenses may be reported as attendant service costs if properly documented in accordance with §355.105 of this title (relating to General Reporting and Documentation Requirements, Methods, and Procedures). (C) Allowable compensation for owners and related parties and definitions of owners and related parties are specified in §355.102(i) and §355.103(b)(2) of this title. (i) Time sheet requirement. Owners and related parties who provide multiple types of attendant service (e.g., direct care workers, direct care trainers, and job coaches) or both attendant services and non-attendant services must maintain daily time sheets that record the time spent on activities in each area. The provider must maintain documentation relating to the compensation, bonuses, and benefits of each owner or related party in accordance with §355.105(b)(2)(B)(xi) of this title. (ii) Calculation of allowable hourly wage rate and benefits. Allowable hourly wage rate and benefits for attendant service work must be the lesser of the actual hourly wage rate paid and benefits paid or the hourly wage rate and benefits for a comparable attendant assumed in the fully-funded model. The fully-funded model is the model as calculated under §355.456(d) of this title (relating to Reimbursement Methodology) prior to any adjustments made in accordance with §355.101 of this title (relating to Introduction) and §355.109 of this title (relating to Adjusting Reimbursement When New Legislation, Regulations or Economic Factors Affect Costs) for the rate period. (iii) Calculation of allowable hours for attendants. Allowable hours per unit of service for an attendant when the reported hours include related-party hours, are determined as follows: (I) Step 1. Determine the hours per unit of service for a comparable attendant-service staff-type assumed in the fully-funded model as defined in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, adjusted for the provider's average Level of Need (LON) during the reporting period. (II) Step 2. Determine the hours per unit of service encompassed by the 90th percentile in the array of hours per unit of service for comparable attendant-service staff-types as reported by those contracted providers not reporting any related-party hours for that staff-type, adjusted for the provider's average LON during the reporting period. (III) Step 3. Determine the greater of Step 1 and Step 2. (IV) Step 4. Determine the actual hours worked by the staff-type per unit of service. (V) Step 5. Determine the lesser of Step 4 and Step 3. This value is the allowable hours per unit of service for the attendant-service staff-type. (iv) Exception to related party adjustment. If at least 40 percent of total labor hours in a specific related party's attendant-service staff-type were provided by non-related-parties, the related-party's hourly wage rate may be the higher of the model assumption for that attendant-service staff-type described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph or the non-related party average for that attendant-service staff-type, so long as the non-related party average does not exceed the related-party's actual hourly wage. (v) Maximum attendant-care hours. During any single fiscal year, the sum of all attendant-care hours reported on any cost report(s) for any individual owner or related party cannot exceed 2,600. (vi) Classification of hours over the limit. Hours, hourly wages and benefits above the limits described in clauses (ii) - (v) of this subparagraph are to be reported as administrative hours, hourly wages and benefits. (3) Placement of vendor hold for change of ownership and contract termination. For services delivered on or before August 31, 2009, the Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) will place a vendor hold on a prior owner at a change of ownership which results in the execution of a new provider agreement or a contract termination. The prior owner must submit a cost report to HHSC for the current reporting period. Upon receipt of an acceptable cost report and resolution of any outstanding balances, the vendor hold will be released. For services delivered on or after September 1, 2010, placement of vendor hold for change of ownership and contract termination will be governed by the information in §355.112 of this title. (4) Ownership change or contract termination and failure to submit a cost report. For services delivered on or before August 31, 2009, providers with an ownership change from one legal entity to a different legal entity or a contract termination that do not submit a cost report for the fiscal year of the ownership change or contract termination within 60 days of the change of ownership or contract termination are subject to recoupment of funds related to fiscal accountability as described in subsection (c)(1)(D) of this section. The recouped funds will not be restored until the provider submits an acceptable cost report and has paid the actual amount due as specified in subsection (c)(1)(A) - (C) of this section. If an acceptable cost report is not received within 365 days of the change of ownership or contract termination date, the recoupment will become permanent. For services delivered on or after September 1, 2010, recoupment of funds related to failure to submit a cost report after an ownership change from one legal entity to a different legal entity or a contract termination will be governed by the information in §355.112 of this title. (5) Failure to submit a cost report. For services delivered on or before August 31, 2009, providers that do not submit a cost report completed in accordance with all applicable rules and instructions within 60 days of the placement of a vendor hold due to the failure to submit the cost report are subject to an immediate recoupment of funds related to fiscal accountability as described in subsection (c)(1)(D) of this section. The recouped funds will not be restored until the provider submits an acceptable cost report and has paid the actual amount due as specified in subsection (c)(1)(A) - (C) of this section. If an acceptable cost report is not received within 365 days of the due date, the recoupment will become permanent. For services delivered on or after September 1, 2010, recoupment of funds related to failure to submit a cost report within 60 days of the placement of a vendor hold due to failure to submit the cost report will be governed by the information in §355.112 of this title. (6) Other applicable rules. For cost reports pertaining to providers' fiscal years ending in calendar year 2004 and subsequent years the following applies: (A) Providers must follow the cost-reporting guidelines as specified in §355.105 of this title. (B) Providers must follow the guidelines in determining whether a cost is allowable or unallowable as specified in §355.102 and §355.103 of this title. (C) Revenues must be reported on the cost report in accordance with §355.104 of this title (relating to Revenues). (7) Field audit and desk review. Desk reviews or field audits are performed on cost reports for all contracted providers. The frequency and nature of the field audits are determined by HHSC to ensure the fiscal integrity of the program. Desk reviews and field audits will be conducted in accordance with §355.106 of this title (relating to Basic Objectives and Criteria for Audit and Desk Review of Cost Reports), and providers will be notified of the results of a desk review or a field audit in accordance with §355.107 of this title (relating to Notification of Exclusions and Adjustments). (8) Reviews of exclusions or adjustments. An ICF/MR provider who disagrees with HHSC's exclusion or adjustment of items in cost reports may request an informal review and, when appropriate, an administrative hearing as specified in §355.110 of this title (relating to Informal Reviews and Formal Appeals). (c) Fiscal accountability. For services delivered on or before August 31, 2009, HHSC will require providers to report all direct costs incurred in their annual fiscal year. HHSC will compare the reported direct service costs to the direct service cost component of the modeled rates. (1) Fiscal accountability calculation. The total direct service revenue of the modeled rates is the direct service portion of the rate multiplied by the number of allowable units paid for services provided during the reporting period. (A) Providers whose direct service costs are 90% or more of the direct service revenues will not be subject to repayment under this section. (B) Providers whose direct service costs are less than 85% of the direct service revenues will be required to pay to HHSC the difference between the direct service costs and 95% of the direct service revenues. (C) Providers whose direct service costs are less than 90% but greater than or equal to 85% of the direct service revenues will be required to pay to HHSC 75% of the difference between the direct service costs and 90% of the direct service revenues. (D) Providers who do not submit an acceptable cost report as described in subsection (b)(4) or (5) of this section will be assumed to have direct service costs equal to 65% of the direct services revenues and HHSC will recoup the difference between 65% of the direct services revenues and 95% of the direct service revenues, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(4) or (5) of this section. (2) Notification of recoupment. Providers will be notified, by certified mail, within 90 days of the determination of their recoupment amount by HHSC of the amount to be repaid to HHSC. If a subsequent review by HHSC or audit results in adjustments to the Cost Report as described in subsection (b)(7) of this section that changes the amount to be repaid to HHSC, the provider will be notified in writing of the adjustments and the adjusted amount to be repaid. HHSC will recoup any amount owed from a provider's vendor payment(s) following the date of the notification letter. (3) Repayment. Repayment will be collected from the following: (A) the provider or legal entity submitting the report; (B) any other legal entity responsible for the debts or liabilities of the submitting entity; or (C) the legal entity on behalf of which a report is submitted. (4) Repayment when ownership change or contract termination occurs. For providers undergoing an ownership change or contract termination, HHSC will recoup any amount owed from the provider's vendor payments that are being held. In cases where funds identified for recoupment cannot be repaid from the held vendor payments, the responsible entity from paragraph (3) of this subsection will be jointly and severally liable for any additional payment due to HHSC. Failure to repay the amount due or submit an acceptable payment plan within 60 days of notification will result in the recoupment of the owed funds from other Medicaid contracts controlled by the responsible entity, placement of a vendor hold on all Medicaid contracts controlled by the responsible entity and will bar the responsible entity from receiving any new contracts with HHSC until repayment is made in full. The responsible entity for these contracts will be notified as described in paragraph (2) of this subsection prior to the recoupment of owed funds, placement of vendor hold and barring of new contracts. (5) Aggregation. (A) Definitions. The following words and terms have the following meanings when used in this paragraph. (i) Aggregation--For an entity defined in clause (iii) of this subparagraph that controls, as defined in clause (iv) of this subparagraph, more than one ICF/MR component code, the process of determining compliance with the spending requirements detailed in paragraph (1) of this subsection for all component codes controlled by the entity in the aggregate rather than requiring each component code to meet its spending requirement individually. For commonly owned corporations defined in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the process of determining compliance with the spending requirements detailed in paragraph (1) of this subsection for all component codes in the controlled small group in the aggregate rather than requiring each component code to meet its spending requirement Cont'd..."

The Texas Health and Human  Services Commission (HHSC) applies the general principles of cost  determination as specified in §355.101 of this title (relating  to Introduction). Providers are reimbursed for waiver services provided  to individuals who meet the criteria for alternatives to nursing facility  care. Additionally, providers are reimbursed a one-time administrative  expense fee for a pre-enrollment assessment of potential waiver participants.  The pre-enrollment assessment covers care planning for the participant. (b) Other sources of cost information. If HHSC has  determined that there is not sufficient reliable cost report data  from which to determine reimbursements and reimbursement ceilings  for waiver services, reimbursements and reimbursement ceilings will  be developed by using data from surveys; cost report data from other  similar programs, consultation with other service providers or professionals  experienced in delivering contracted services; and other sources. (c) Waiver reimbursement determination. Recommended  reimbursements are determined in the following manner: (1) Unit of service reimbursement. Reimbursement for  personal assistance services and in-home respite care services, and  cost per unit of service for nursing services provided by a registered  nurse (RN), nursing services provided by a licensed vocational nurse  (LVN), physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech/language therapy,  supported employment, employment assistance, and day activity and  health services will be determined on a fee-for-service basis in the  following manner: (A) Total allowable costs for each provider will be  determined by analyzing the allowable historical costs reported on  the cost report. (B) Total allowable costs are reduced by the amount  of the pre-enrollment expense fee and requisition fee revenues accrued  for the reporting period. (C) Each provider's total reported allowable costs,  excluding depreciation and mortgage interest, are projected from the  historical cost-reporting period to the prospective reimbursement  period as described in §355.108 of this title (relating to Determination  of Inflation Indices). The prospective reimbursement period is the  period of time that the reimbursement is expected to be in effect. (D) Payroll taxes and employee benefits are allocated  to each salary line item on the cost report on a pro rata basis based  on the portion of that salary line item to the amount of total salary  expense for the appropriate group of staff. Employee benefits will  be charged to a specific salary line item if the benefits are reported  separately. The allocated payroll taxes are Federal Insurance Contributions  Act (FICA) or Social Security, Medicare Contributions, Workers' Compensation  Insurance (WCI), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and the  Texas Unemployment Compensation Act (TUCA). (E) Allowable administrative and facility costs are  allocated or spread to each waiver service cost component on a pro  rata basis based on the portion of each waiver service's units of  service to the amount of total waiver units of service. (F) For nursing services provided by an RN, nursing  services provided by an LVN, physical therapy, occupational therapy,  speech/language therapy, supported employment, employment assistance,  and in-home respite care services, an allowable cost per unit of service  is calculated for each contracted provider cost report for each service.  The allowable cost per unit of service, for each contracted provider  cost report is multiplied by 1.044. This adjusted allowable cost per  unit of service may be combined into an array with the allowable cost  per unit of service of similar services provided by other programs  in determining rates for these services in accordance with §355.502  of this title (relating to Reimbursement Methodology for Common Services  in Home and Community-Based Services Waivers). (G) For personal assistance services, two cost areas  are created: (i) The attendant cost area includes salaries, wages,  benefits, and mileage reimbursement calculated as specified in §355.112  of this title (relating to Attendant Compensation Rate Enhancement). (ii) Another attendant cost area is created which includes  the other personal attendant services costs not included in clause  (i) of this subparagraph as determined in subparagraphs (A) - (E)  of this paragraph. An allowable cost per unit of service is determined  for each contracted provider cost report for the other attendant cost  area. The allowable cost per unit of service for each contracted provider  cost report are arrayed. The units of service for each contracted  provider cost report in the array are summed until the median unit  of service is reached. The corresponding expense to the median unit  of service is determined and is multiplied by 1.044. (iii) The attendant cost area and the other attendant  cost area are summed to determine the personal assistance services  cost per unit of service. (2) Per day reimbursement. (A) The reimbursement for Adult Foster Care (AFC) and  out-of-home respite care in an AFC home will be determined as a per  day reimbursement using a method based on modeled projected expenses,  which are developed using data from surveys, cost report data from  other similar programs, consultation with other service providers  or professionals experienced in delivering contracted services, and  other sources. The room and board payments for AFC Services are not  covered in these reimbursements and will be paid to providers from  the client's Supplemental Security Income, less a personal needs allowance. (B) The reimbursement for Assisted Living/Residential  Care (AL/RC) will be determined as a per day reimbursement in accordance  with §355.509(a) - (c)(2)(E)(iii) of this title (relating to  Reimbursement Methodology for Residential Care). (i) The per day reimbursement for attendant care for  each of the six levels of care will be determined based upon client  need for attendant care. (ii) A total reimbursement amount will be calculated  and the proposed reimbursement is equal to the total reimbursement  less the client's room and board payments. (iii) The room and board payment is paid to the provider  by the client from the client's Supplemental Security Income (SSI),  less a personal needs allowance. (iv) The reimbursement for out-of-home respite in an  AL/RC facility is determined using the same methodology as the reimbursement  for AL/RC except that the out-of-home respite rates: (I) are set at the rate for providers who choose not  to participate in the attendant compensation rate enhancement; and (II) include room and board costs equal to the client's  SSI, less a personal needs allowance. (v) When the SSI is increased or decreased by the Federal  Social Security Administration, the reimbursement for AL/RC and out-of-home  respite provided in an AL/RC facility will be adjusted in amounts  equal to the increase or decrease in SSI received by clients. (C) The reimbursement for out-of-home respite care  provided in a Nursing Facility will be based on the amount determined  for the Nursing Facility case mix class into which the CBA participant  is classified. (D) The reimbursement for Personal Care 3 will be composed  of two rate components, one for the direct care cost center and one  for the non-direct care cost center. (i) Direct care costs. The rate component for the direct  care cost center will be determined by modeling the cost of the minimum  required staffing for the Personal Care 3 setting, as specified by  the Department of Aging and Disability Services, and using staff costs  and other statistics from the most recently audited cost reports from  providers delivering similar care. (ii) Non-direct care costs. The rate component for  the non-direct care cost center will be equal to the non-attendant  portion of the non-apartment assisted living rate per day for non-participants  in the Attendant Compensation Rate Enhancement. Providers receiving  the Personal Care 3 rate are not eligible to participate in the Attendant  Compensation Rate Enhancement and receive direct care add-on's to  the Personal Care 3 rates. (3) Emergency Response Services. The reimbursement  for Emergency Response Services will be determined as monthly reimbursement  ceiling, based on the ceiling amount determined in accordance with §355.510  of this title (relating to Reimbursement Methodology for Emergency  Response Services (ERS)). (4) Requisition fees. Requisition fees are reimbursements  paid to the CBA home and community support services contracted providers  for their efforts in acquiring adaptive aids, medical supplies, dental  services, and minor home modifications for CBA participants. Reimbursement  for requisition fees for adaptive aids, medical supplies, dental services,  and minor home modifications will vary based on the actual cost of  the adaptive aids, medical supplies, dental services, and minor home  modifications. Reimbursements are determined using a method based  on modeled projected expenses, which are developed by using data from  surveys; cost report data from similar programs; consultation with  other service providers and/or professionals experienced in delivering  contracted services; and/or other sources. (5) Pre-enrollment expense fee. Reimbursement for pre-enrollment  assessment is determined using a method based on modeled projected  expenses that are developed by using data from surveys; cost report  data from other similar programs; consultation with other service  providers and/or professionals experienced in delivering contracted  services; and other sources. (6) Home-Delivered Meals. The reimbursement for Home-Delivered  Meals will be determined on a per meal basis, based on the ceiling  amount determined in accordance with §355.511 of this title (relating  to Reimbursement Methodology for Home-Delivered Meals). (7) Exceptions to the reimbursement determination methodology.  HHSC may adjust reimbursement if new legislation, regulations, or  economic factors affect costs, according to §355.109 of this  title (relating to Adjusting Reimbursement When New Legislation, Regulations,  or Economic Factors Affect Costs). (d) Authority to determine reimbursement. The authority  to determine reimbursement is specified in §355.101 of this title. (e) Reporting of cost. (1) Cost reporting guidelines. If HHSC requires a cost  report for any waiver service in this program, providers must follow  the cost-reporting guidelines as specified in §355.105 of this  title (relating to General Reporting and Documentation Requirements,  Methods, and Procedures). (2) Excused from submission of cost reports. If required  by HHSC, a contracted provider must submit a cost report unless the  provider meets one or more of the conditions in §355.105(b)(4)(D)  of this title. (3) Number of cost reports to be submitted. (A) Contracted providers participating in the attendant  compensation rate enhancement. (i) At the same level of enhancement. If all the contracts  under the legal entity participate in the enhancement at the same  level of enhancement, the contracted provider must submit one cost  report for the legal entity. (ii) At different levels of enhancement. If all the  contracts under the legal entity participate in the enhancement but  they participate at more than one enhancement level, the contracted  provider must submit one cost report for each level of enhancement. (B) Contracted providers not participating in the attendant  compensation rate enhancement. If all the contracts under the legal  entity do not participate in the enhancement, the contracted provider  must submit one cost report for the legal entity. (C) Contractors participating and not participating  in attendant compensation rate enhancement. (i) At the same level of enhancement. If some of the  contracts under the legal entity do not participate in the enhancement  and the rest of the contracts under the legal entity participate at  the same level of enhancement, the contracted provider must submit: (I) one cost report for the contracts that do not participate;  and (II) one cost report for the contracts that do participate. (ii) At different levels of enhancement. If some of  the contracts under the legal entity do not participate in the enhancement  and the rest of the contracts under the legal entity participate in  the enhancement but they participate at more than one enhancement  level, the contracted provider must submit: (I) one cost report for the contracts that do not participate;  and (II) one cost report for each level of enhancement. (4) Reporting and verification of allowable cost. (A) Providers are responsible for reporting only allowable  costs on the cost report, except where cost report instructions indicate  that other costs are to be reported in specific lines or sections.  Only allowable cost information is used to determine recommended reimbursements.  HHSC excludes from reimbursement determination any unallowable expenses  included in the cost report and makes the appropriate adjustments  to expenses and other information reported by providers; the purpose  is to ensure that the database reflects costs and other information  which are necessary for the provision of services, and are consistent  with federal and state regulations.

The Texas Health and Human  Services Commission (HHSC) applies the general principles of cost  determination as specified in §355.101 of this title (relating  to Introduction). Providers are reimbursed for waiver services provided  to Medicaid-enrolled persons with related conditions. Additionally,  providers will be reimbursed a one-time administrative expense fee  for a pre-enrollment assessment of potential waiver participants.  The pre-enrollment assessment covers care planning for the participant. (b) Reporting of cost. (1) Providers must follow the cost reporting guidelines  as specified in §355.105 of this title (relating to General Reporting  and Documentation Requirements, Methods, and Procedures). (2) Number of cost reports to be submitted. All legal  entities must submit a cost report unless the number of days between  the date the legal entity's first Texas Department of Aging and Disability  Services (DADS) client received services and the legal entity's fiscal  year end is 30 days or fewer. (A) Contracted providers participating in the attendant  compensation rate enhancement. (i) At the same level of enhancement. If all the contracts  under the legal entity participate in the enhancement at the same  level of enhancement, the contracted provider must submit one cost  report for the legal entity.

(3) Excused from submission of cost reports. If required  by HHSC, a contracted provider must submit a cost report unless the  provider meets one or more of the conditions in §355.105(b)(4)(D)  of this title. (c) Waiver reimbursement determination methodology. (1) Unit of service reimbursement or reimbursement  ceiling by unit of service. Reimbursement or reimbursement ceilings  for related-conditions waiver services, habilitation, nursing services  provided by a registered nurse (RN), nursing services provided by  a licensed vocational nurse (LVN), physical therapy, occupational  therapy, speech/language therapy, behavioral support, auditory integration  training/auditory enhancement training (audiology services), nutritional  services, employment assistance, supported employment, day activity  and health services, and in-home and out-of-home respite care services  will be determined on a fee-for-service basis. These services are  provided under §1915(c) of the Social Security Act Medicaid waiver  for persons with related conditions. (2) Monthly reimbursement. The reimbursement for case  management waiver service will be determined as a monthly reimbursement.  This service is provided under the §1915(c) of the Social Security  Act Medicaid waiver for persons with related conditions. (3) Reporting and verification of allowable cost. (A) Providers are responsible for reporting only allowable  costs on the cost report, except where cost report instructions indicate  that other costs are to be reported in specific lines or sections.  Only allowable cost information is used to determine recommended reimbursements.  HHSC excludes from reimbursement determination any unallowable expenses  included in the cost report and makes the appropriate adjustments  to expenses and other information reported by providers; the purpose  is to ensure that the database reflects costs and other information  that are necessary for the provision of services and are consistent  with federal and state regulations. (B) Individual cost reports may not be included in  the database used for reimbursement determination if: (i) there is reasonable doubt as to the accuracy or  allowability of a significant part of the information reported; or (ii) an auditor determines that reported costs are  not verifiable. (4) Reimbursement determination. Recommended unit of  service reimbursements and reimbursement ceilings by unit of service  are determined in the following manner: (A) Unit of service reimbursement for habilitation,  and cost per unit of service for nursing services provided by an RN,  nursing services provided by an LVN, physical therapy, occupational  therapy, speech/language therapy, behavioral support services, auditory  integration training/auditory enhancement training (audiology services),  nutritional services, employment assistance, supported employment,  and in-home and out-of-home respite care are determined in the following  manner: (i) The total allowable cost for each contracted provider  cost report will be determined by analyzing the allowable historical  costs reported on the cost report and other pertinent cost survey  information. (ii) The total allowable cost is reduced by the amount  of the administrative expense fee and requisition fee revenues accrued  for the reporting period. (iii) Each provider's total allowable cost, excluding  depreciation and mortgage interest, is projected from the historical  cost reporting period to the prospective reimbursement period as described  in §355.108 of this title (relating to Determination of Inflation  Indices). (iv) Payroll taxes and employee benefits are allocated  to each salary line item on the cost report on a pro rata basis based  on the portion of that salary line item to the amount of total salary  expense for the appropriate group of staff. Employee benefits will  be charged to a specific salary line item if the benefits are reported  separately. The allocated payroll taxes are Federal Insurance Contributions  Act (FICA) or social security, Medicare contributions, Workers' compensation  Insurance (WCI), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and the  Texas Unemployment Compensation Act (TUCA). (v) Allowable administrative and facility costs are  allocated or spread to each waiver service cost component on a pro  rata basis based on the portion of each waiver service's units of  service to the amount of total waiver units of service. (vi) Each provider's projected total allowable cost  is divided by the number of units of service to determine the projected  cost per unit of service. (vii) For nursing services provided by an RN, nursing  services provided by an LVN, physical therapy, occupational therapy,  speech/language therapy, in-home respite care, behavioral support  services, auditory integration training/auditory enhancement training  (audiology services), nutritional services, employment assistance,  and supported employment, the projected cost per unit of service,  for each provider is multiplied by 1.044. This adjusted allowable  cost per unit of service may be combined into an array with the allowable  cost per unit of service of similar services provided by other programs  in determining rates for these services in accordance with §355.502  of this title (relating to Reimbursement Methodology for Common Services  in Home and Community-Based Services Waivers). (viii) For habilitation services two cost areas are  created: (I) The attendant cost area includes salaries, wages,  benefits, and mileage reimbursement calculated as specified in §355.112  of this title (relating to Attendant Compensation Rate Enhancement). (II) Another attendant cost area is created which includes  the other habilitation services costs not included in subclause (I)  of this clause as determined in clauses (i) - (v) of this subparagraph  to create an other attendant cost area. An allowable cost per unit  of service is calculated for the other habilitation cost area. The  allowable costs per unit of service for each contracted provider cost  report are arrayed and weighted by the number of units of service,  and the median cost per unit of service is calculated. The median  cost per unit of service is multiplied by 1.044. (III) The attendant cost area and the other attendant  cost area are summed to determine the habilitation attendant cost  per unit of service. (ix) For out-of-home respite care, the allowable costs  per unit of service are calculated as determined in clauses (i) -  (vi) of this subparagraph. The allowable costs per unit of service  for each contracted provider cost report are multiplied by 1.044.  The costs per unit of service are then arrayed and weighted by the  number of units of service, and the median cost per unit of service  is calculated. (B) The monthly reimbursement for case management services  is determined in the following manner: (i) Total allowable costs for each provider will be  determined by analyzing the allowable historical costs reported on  the cost report and other pertinent cost survey information. (ii) Total allowable costs are reduced by the amount  of administrative expense fee revenues reported. (iii) Each provider's total allowable costs, excluding  depreciation and mortgage interest, are projected from the historical  cost reporting period to the prospective reimbursement period as described  in §355.108 of this title (relating to Determination of Inflation  Indices). (iv) Payroll taxes and employee benefits are allocated  to each salary line item on the cost report on a pro rata basis based  on the portion of that salary line item to the amount of total salary  expense for the appropriate group of staff. Employee benefits will  be charged to a specific salary line item if the benefits are reported  separately. The allocated payroll taxes are Federal Insurance Contributions  Act (FICA) or social security, Medicare contributions, Workers' compensation  Insurance (WCI), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and the  Texas Unemployment Compensation Act (TUCA). (v) Each provider's projected total allowable costs  are divided by the number of monthly units of service to determine  the projected cost per client month of service. (vi) Each provider's projected cost per client month  of service is arrayed from low to high and weighted by the number  of units of service and the median cost per client month of service  is calculated. (vii) The median projected cost per client month of  service is multiplied by 1.044. (C) The unit of service reimbursement for day activity  and health services is determined in accordance with §355.6907  (Relating to Reimbursement Methodology for Day Activity and Health  Services). (D) HHSC also adjusts reimbursement according to §355.109  of this title (relating to Adjusting Reimbursement When New Legislation,  Regulations, or Economic Factors Affect Costs) if new legislation,  regulations, or economic factors affect costs. (5) The reimbursement for support family services and  continued family services will be determined as a per day rate using  a method based on modeled costs which are developed by using data  from surveys, cost report data from other similar programs, payment  rates from other similar programs, consultation with other service  providers and/or professionals experienced in delivering contracted  services, or other sources as determined appropriate by HHSC. The  per day rate will have two parts, one part for the child placing agency  and one part for the support family. (d) Administrative expense fee determination methodology. (1) One-time administrative expense fee. Reimbursement  for the pre-enrollment assessment and care planning process required  to determine eligibility for the waiver program will be provided as  a one-time administrative expense fee. (2) Administrative expense fee determination process.  The recommended administrative expense fee is determined using a method  based on modeled projected expenses which are developed using data  from surveys, cost report data from other similar programs or services,  professionals' experience in delivering similar services, and other  relevant sources. (e) Requisition fees. Requisition fees are reimbursements  paid to the CLASS direct service agency contracted providers for their  efforts in acquiring adaptive aids, medical supplies, dental services,  specialized therapies, and minor home modifications for CLASS participants.  Reimbursement for requisition fees for adaptive aids, medical supplies,  dental services, specialized therapies, and minor home modifications  will vary based on the actual cost of the adaptive aids, medical Cont'd..."

On a biennial basis,  providers must submit cost reports to Texas Health and Human Services  Commission (HHSC) Rate Analysis only in even years, beginning with  providers' 2018 cost reports. HHSC applies the general principles  of cost determination as specified in §355.101 of this title  (relating to Introduction).  (1) Attendant service costs. Attendant service costs  are defined in §355.112 of this title (relating to Attendant  Compensation Rate Enhancement).  (2) Staff who provide both attendant and non-attendant  services. For staff whose duties include work other than the provision  of attendant services for the provider, time spent providing attendant  services and associated expenses may be reported as attendant service  costs if properly documented in accordance with §355.105 of this  title (relating to General Reporting and Documentation Requirements,  Methods, and Procedures).  (3) Providers must report the following costs:  (A) Staff wages related to the delivery of attendant  services.  (B) These costs may be either the provider's actual  expense or contracted expenditures.  (b) Reviews of exclusions or adjustments. A provider  who disagrees with HHSC's exclusion or adjustment of items in cost  reports may request an informal review and, when appropriate, an administrative  hearing as specified in §355.110 of this title (relating to Informal  Reviews and Formal Appeals).  (c) Field audit and desk review. Desk reviews or field  audits are performed on cost reports for all contracted providers.  The frequency and nature of the field audits are determined by HHSC  to ensure the fiscal integrity of the program. Desk reviews and field  audits will be conducted in accordance with §355.106 of this  title (relating to Basic Objectives and Criteria for Audit and Desk  Review of Cost Reports).  (d) Notification of exclusions and adjustments. HHSC  will notify a provider of the results of a desk review or field audit  in accordance with §355.107 of this title (relating to Notification  of Exclusions and Adjustments).  (e) Cost reporting guidelines. Providers must follow  the cost-reporting guidelines as specified in §355.105 of this  title.  (f) Allowable and unallowable costs. Providers must  follow the guidelines in determining whether a cost is allowable or  unallowable as specified in §355.102 and §355.103 of this  title (relating to General Principles of Allowable and Unallowable  Costs, and Specifications for Allowable and Unallowable Costs).  (g) Revenues. Revenues must be reported on the cost  report in accordance with §355.104 of this title (relating to  Revenues).  (h) Related parties. Allowable compensation for owners  and related parties and definitions of owners and related parties  are specified in §355.102(i) and §355.103(b)(2) of this  title.  (1) Time sheet requirement. Owners and related parties  who provide multiple types of attendant service (e.g., direct care  workers, direct care trainers, and job coaches) or both attendant  services and non-attendant services must maintain daily time sheets  that record the time spent on activities in each area. The provider  must maintain documentation relating to the compensation, bonuses,  and benefits of each owner or related party in accordance with §355.105(b)(2)(B)(xi)  of this title.  (2) Calculation of allowable hourly wage rate and benefits.  Allowable hourly wage rate and benefits for attendant service work  must be the lesser of the actual hourly wage rate paid and benefits  paid or the hourly wage rate and benefits for a comparable attendant  assumed in the fully-funded model. The fully-funded model is the model  as calculated under §355.723(d) of this title (relating to Reimbursement  Methodology for Home and Community-based Services) prior to any adjustments  made in accordance with §355.101 of this title and §355.109  of this title (relating to Adjusting Reimbursement When New Legislation,  Regulations or Economic Factors Affect Costs) for the rate period.  (3) Calculation of allowable hours for attendants.  Allowable hours per unit of service for an attendant when the reported  hours include related-party hours, are determined as follows:  (A) Step 1. Determine the hours per unit of service  for a comparable attendant-service staff-type assumed in the fully-funded  model as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection, adjusted for  the provider's average Level of Need (LON) during the reporting period.  For TxHmL, until such time as LONs are established, the provider's  average LON is assumed to be LON 5.  (B) Step 2. Determine the hours per unit of service  encompassed by the 90th percentile in the array of hours per unit  of service for comparable attendant-service staff-types as reported  by those contracted providers not reporting any related-party hours  for that staff-type, adjusted for the provider's average LON during  the reporting period. For TxHmL, until such time as LONs are established,  the provider's average LON is assumed to be LON 5.  (C) Step 3. Determine the greater of Step 1 and Step  2.  (D) Step 4. Determine the actual hours worked by the  staff-type per unit of service.  (E) Step 5. Determine the lesser of Step 4 and Step  3. This value is the allowable hours per unit of service for the attendant-service  staff-type in question.  (4) Exception to related-party adjustment. If at least  40 percent of total labor hours in a specific related-party's attendant-service  staff-type were provided by non-related-parties, the related-party's  hourly wage rate may be the higher of the model assumption for that  attendant-service staff-type described in paragraph (2) of this subsection  or the non-related party average for that attendant-service staff-type,  so long as the non-related party average does not exceed the related-party's  actual hourly wage.  (5) Maximum attendant-care hours. During any single  fiscal year, the sum of all attendant-care hours reported on any cost  report(s) for any individual owner or related party cannot exceed  2,600.  (6) Classification of hours over the limit. Hours,  hourly wages and benefits above the limits described in paragraphs  (2) - (5) of this subsection are to be reported as administrative  hours, hourly wages and benefits.  (i) Adjusting reported cost. Each provider's total  reported allowable costs, excluding depreciation and mortgage interest,  are projected from the historical cost-reporting period to the prospective  reimbursement period as described in §355.108 of this title (relating  to Determination of Inflation Indices). HHSC may adjust reimbursement  if new legislation, regulations, or economic factors affect costs,  according to §355.109 of this title.  (j) Fiscal Accountability for HCS. This subsection  applies to services delivered on or before August 31, 2009 and only  for HCS program services.  (1) General principles. Fiscal accountability is a  process used to gauge the ongoing financial performance under the  reimbursement rates.  (2) Annual reporting. Fiscal accountability will consist  of the annual reporting of the direct service costs including wages,  and benefits, from all providers. The data will be collected on a  cost report designed by HHSC in accordance with §355.105(b) of  this title.  (A) The Department of Aging and Disability Services  (DADS) will place a vendor hold on payments to a provider whose provider  agreement is being assigned or terminated. The provider will submit  a cost report for the current reporting period to HHSC. Upon receipt  of an acceptable cost report and repayment of any amounts due in accordance  with this section, the vendor hold will be released.  (B) Providers that do not submit a cost report completed  in accordance with all applicable rules and instructions within 60  days of the placement of a vendor hold due to the failure to submit  the cost report are subject to an immediate recoupment of funds related  to fiscal accountability as described in paragraph (4)(E) of this  subsection. The recouped funds will not be restored until the provider  submits an acceptable cost report and has paid the actual amount due  as specified in paragraphs (5) - (7) of this subsection. If an acceptable  cost report is not received within 365 days of the due date, the recoupment  will become permanent.  (C) Providers with an ownership change from one legal  entity to a different legal entity or a contract termination that  do not submit a cost report for the fiscal year of the ownership change  or contract termination within 60 days of the change of ownership  or contract termination are subject to recoupment of funds related  to fiscal accountability as described in paragraph (4)(E) of this  subsection. The recouped funds will not be restored until the provider  submits an acceptable cost report and has paid the actual amount due  as specified in paragraphs (5) - (7) of this subsection. If an acceptable  cost report is not received within 365 days of the change of ownership  or contract termination date, the recoupment will become permanent.  (3) Comparison of direct-service costs to total direct-service  revenue. HHSC will require providers to report all direct costs incurred  on an annual fiscal year basis. HHSC will compare the reported direct  service costs to the total direct service revenue.  (4) Calculation of direct-service revenues and fiscal  accountability repayment. Direct Service Revenues are calculated by  multiplying the number of units eligible for payment that have been  paid for services delivered during the reporting period times the  appropriate direct service portion of the rate for the service billed.  (A) Providers whose direct service costs are 90% or  more of the direct service revenues will not be subject to repayment  under this section.  (B) Providers whose direct service costs are less than  90% but greater than or equal to 85% of the direct service revenues  will be required to pay to DADS 50% of the difference between the  direct service costs and 90% of the direct service revenues.  (C) Providers whose direct service costs are less than  85% but greater than or equal to 80% of the direct service revenues  will be required to pay to DADS 100% of the difference between the  direct service costs and 85% of the direct service revenues plus 50%  of the difference between 85% and 90% of the direct service revenues.  (D) Providers whose direct service costs are less than  80% of the direct service revenues will be required to pay to DADS  the difference between the direct service costs and 95% of the direct  service revenues.  (E) Providers who do not submit a cost report as described  in paragraph (2)(B) or (C) of this subsection will be assumed to have  direct service costs equal to 65% of the direct services revenues  and will be required to pay to DADS the difference between 65% of  the direct services revenues and 95% of the direct service revenues,  subject to the provisions of paragraph (2)(B) or (C) of this subsection.  (5) Notification of recoupment. Providers will be notified,  by certified mail, within 90 days of the determination of their recoupment  amount by HHSC of the amount to be repaid to HHSC. If a subsequent  review by HHSC or audit results in adjustments to the cost report  as described in subsection (a) of this section that change the amount  to be repaid to HHSC, the provider will be notified in writing of  the adjustments and the adjusted amount to be repaid. Providers will  submit the repayment amount within 60 days of notification.  (6) Repayment. Repayment will be made by the following:  (A) the provider or legal entity submitting the report;  (B) any other legal entity responsible for the debts  or liabilities of the submitting entity; or  (C) the legal entity on behalf of which a report is  submitted.  (7) Providers required to repay revenues to DADS will  be jointly and severally liable for any repayment. DADS will apply  a vendor hold on Medicaid payments to a provider for not making the  payment to DADS within 60 days of receiving notice.  (8) Aggregation.  (A) Definitions. The following words and terms have  the following meanings when used in this paragraph.  (i) Aggregation--For an entity defined in clause (iii)  of this subparagraph that controls, as defined in clause (iv) of this  subparagraph, more than one HCS component code, the process of determining  compliance with the spending requirements detailed in paragraph (4)  of this subsection for all component codes controlled by the entity  in the aggregate rather than requiring each component code to meet  its spending requirement individually. For commonly owned corporations  defined in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the process of determining  compliance with the spending requirements detailed in paragraph (4)  of this subsection for all component codes in the controlled small  group in the aggregate rather than requiring each component code to  meet its spending requirement individually. Corporations that do not  meet the definitions under clauses (ii) - (iii) of this subparagraph  are not eligible for aggregation.  (ii) Commonly owned corporations--two or more corporations  where five or fewer identical persons who are individuals, estates,  or trusts own greater than 50 percent of the total voting power in  each corporation.  (iii) Entity--a parent company, sole member, individual,  limited partnership, or group of limited partnerships controlled by  the same general partner.  Cont'd..."

The Texas Health and  Human Services Commission (HHSC) sets payment rates to be paid prospectively  to Home and Community-based Services (HCS) and Texas Home Living (TxHmL)  providers.  (b) Levels of need. (1) Variable rates. Rates vary by level of need (LON)  for the following services: (A) HCS day habilitation (DH);  (B) host home (HH)/companion care (CC);  (C) residential support services (RSS); (D) supervised living (SL); and  (E) effective upon service claims being made billable  through the Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership (TMHP):  (i) HCS in-home DH; (ii) HCS out-of-home DH;  (iii) HCS out-of-home respite (HCS OHR) in a DH facility;  (iv) HCS OHR in a setting where SL or RSS is provided;  and  (v) HCS OHR in a setting where HH/CC is provided.  (2) Non-variable rates. Rates do not vary by LON for  the following services: (A) audiology;  (B) behavioral support;  (C) cognitive rehabilitative therapy (CRT);  (D) community support services (CSS);  (E) dietary;  (F) employment assistance (EA);  (G) high medical needs licensed vocational nurse (LVN);  (H) high medical needs registered nurse (RN);  (I) high medical needs support;  (J) LVN;  (K) occupational therapy (OT);  (L) physical therapy (PT);  (M) RN;  (N) respite;  (O) social work;  (P) speech therapy;  (Q) supported employment (SE);  (R) supported home living (SHL); and  (S) effective upon service claims being made billable  through TMHP:  (i) HCS in-home respite (IHR);  (ii) HCS OHR in a camp;  (iii) HCS OHR in a respite facility;  (iv) TxHmL in-home DH;  (v) TxHmL out-of-home DH;  (vi) TxHmL OHR in a DH facility;  (vii) TxHmL OHR in a setting where HH/CC is provided; (viii) TxHmL OHR in a setting where SL or RSS is provided;  and  (ix) HCS and TxHmL OHR in a setting that is not listed  above.  (c) Recommended rates.  (1) Rate models. The recommended modeled rates are  determined for each HCS and TxHmL service listed in subsection (b)(1)  - (2) of this section by type and, for services listed in subsection  (b)(1) of this section, by LON to include the following cost components:  direct care worker staffing costs (wages, benefits, modeled staffing  ratios for direct care workers, direct care trainers and job coaches),  other direct service staffing costs (wages for direct care supervisors,  benefits, modeled staffing ratios); facility costs (for respite care  only); room and board costs for overnight, OHR care; administration  and operation costs; and professional consultation and program support  costs. The determination of all components except for the direct care  worker staffing costs component is based on cost reports submitted  by HCS and TxHmL providers in accordance with §355.722 of this  subchapter (relating to Reporting Costs by Home and Community-based  Services (HCS) and Texas Home Living (TxHmL) Providers). The determination  of the direct care worker staffing costs component is calculated as  specified in §355.112 of this chapter (relating to Attendant  Compensation Rate Enhancement).

(A) Effective July 1, 2017, the recommended modeled  rates for HCS SHL and TxHmL CSS include the following cost components:  direct care worker staffing costs, and administration and operation  costs. The modeled rates for these two services do not include a cost  component for other direct service staffing costs. The determination  of the administration and operation cost component is calculated as  specified in subsection (d)(10) of this section. The determination  of the direct care worker staffing costs component is calculated as  specified in §355.112 of this chapter.  (B) Effective September 1, 2019, the recommended modeled  rate for HCS SHL is calculated as specified in subsection (c)(1) and  subsection (d) of this section.  (C) Effective September 1, 2019, the recommended modeled  rate for TxHmL CSS is equal to the rate that was in effect for these  services on August 31, 2019.  (3) High medical needs support. Payment rates for high  medical needs support are developed based on payment rates determined  for other programs that provide similar services. If payment rates  are not available from other programs that provide similar services,  payment rates are determined using a pro forma analysis in accordance  with §355.105(h) of this chapter (relating to General Reporting  and Documentation Requirements, Methods, and Procedures). (d) Administration and operation cost component. The  administration and operation cost component included in the recommended  rates described in subsection (c) of this section for each HCS and  TxHmL service type is determined as follows. (1) Step 1. Determine total projected administration  and operation costs and projected units of service by service type  using cost reports submitted by HCS and TxHmL providers in accordance  with §355.722 of this subchapter. (2) Step 2. Determine the HH/CC coordinator component  of the HH/CC rate as follows: (A) For fiscal years 2010 through 2013, the HH/CC coordinator  component of the HH/CC rate was modeled using the weighted average  HH/CC coordinator wage as reported on the most recently available  and reliable audited HCS cost report plus 10.25 percent for payroll  taxes and benefits inflated to the rate period and a consumer to HH/CC  coordinator ratio of 1:15.  (B) For fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the HH/CC coordinator  component of the HH/CC rate was remodeled using a consumer to HH/CC  coordinator ratio of 1:20.  (C) For fiscal years 2014 and thereafter, this component  is determined by summing total reported HH/CC coordinator wages and  allocated payroll taxes and benefits from the most recently available  audited HCS cost report, inflating those costs to the rate period, and  dividing the resulting product by the total number of host home units  of service reported on that cost report. (3) Step 3. Determine total HH/CC coordinator dollars  as follows. Multiply the HH/CC coordinator component of the HH/CC  rate from paragraph (2) of this subsection by the total number of  HH/CC units of service reported on the most recently available, reliable  audited HCS cost report database. (4) Step 4. Determine total projected administration  and operation costs after offsetting total HH/CC coordinator dollars  as follows. Subtract the total HH/CC coordinator dollars from paragraph  (3) of this subsection from the total projected administration and  operation costs from paragraph (1) of this subsection. (5) Step 5. Determine projected weighted units of service  for each HCS and TxHmL service type as follows.  (A) SL and RSS in HCS. Projected weighted units of  service for SL and RSS equal projected SL and RSS units of service  times a weight of 1.00. (B) DH in HCS and TxHmL. Projected weighted units of  service for DH equal projected DH units of service times a weight  of 0.25. (C) HH/CC in HCS. Projected weighted units of service  for HH/CC equal projected HH/CC units of service times a weight of  0.50. (D) SHL in HCS, high medical needs support in HCS,  and CSS in TxHmL. For each service, projected weighted units of service  equal projected units of service times a weight of 0.30. (E) Respite in HCS and TxHmL. Projected weighted units  of service for respite equal projected respite units of service times  a weight of 0.20. (F) SE in HCS and TxHmL. Projected weighted units of  service for SE equal projected units of service times a weight of  0.25. (G) Behavioral support in HCS and TxHmL. Projected  weighted units of service for behavioral support equal projected behavioral  support units of service times a weight of 0.18. (H) Audiology, CRT, OT, PT, and speech therapy in HCS  and TxHmL. Projected weighted units of service for audiology, CRT,  OT, PT, and speech therapy equal projected audiology, CRT, OT, PT,  and speech therapy units of service times a weight of 0.18. (I) Social work in HCS. Projected weighted units of  service for social work equal projected social work units of service  times a weight of 0.18. (J) Nursing in HCS and TxHmL and high medical needs  nursing in HCS. Projected weighted units of service for nursing and  high medical needs nursing equal projected nursing and high medical  needs nursing units of service times a weight of 0.25. (K) EA in HCS and TxHmL. Projected weighted units of  service for EA equal projected EA units of service times a weight  of 0.25. (L) Dietary in HCS and TxHmL. Projected weighted units  of service for dietary equal projected dietary units of service times  a weight of 0.18. (6) Step 6. Calculate total projected weighted units  of service by summing the projected weighted units of service from  paragraph (5)(A) - (L) of this subsection. (7) Step 7. Calculate the percent of total administration  and operation costs to be allocated to the service type by dividing  the projected weighted units for the service type from paragraph (5)  of this subsection by the total projected weighted units of service  from paragraph (6) of this subsection. (8) Step 8. Calculate the total administration and  operation cost to be allocated to that service type by multiplying  the percent of total administration and operation costs allocated  to the service type from paragraph (7) of this subsection by the total  administration and operation costs after offsetting total host home/companion  care coordinator dollars from paragraph (4) of this subsection. (9) Step 9. Calculate the administration and operation  cost component per unit of service for each HCS and TxHmL service  type by dividing the total administration and operation cost to be  allocated to that service type from paragraph (8) of this subsection  by the projected units of service for that service type from paragraph  (1) of this subsection. (10) Step 10. The final recommended administration  and operation cost component per unit of service for each HCS and  TxHmL service type is calculated as follows.  (A) For the following services, multiply the administration  and operation cost component from paragraph (9) of this subsection  by 1.044:  (i) CSS;  (ii) EA;  (iii) SE;  (iv) SHL; and  (v) effective upon service claims being made billable  through TMHP:  (I) in-home DH;  (II) HCS OHR in a camp;  (III) HCS OHR in a respite facility;  (IV) HCS OHR in a setting where HH/CC is provided;  and  (V) HCS OHR in a setting that is not listed.  (B) For the following services, multiply the administration  and operation cost component from paragraph (9) of this subsection  by 1.07:  (i) RSS;  (ii) SL; and  (iii) effective upon service claims being made billable  through TMHP:  (I) out-of-home DH;  (II) HCS OHR in a DH facility; and  (III) HCS OHR in a setting where SL or RSS is provided.  (11) Step 11. Effective July 1, 2017, the final recommended  administration and operation cost component per unit of service for  SHL in HCS, CSS in TxHmL, and high medical needs support in HCS is  equal to the administrative and facility cost component of habilitation  services in the Community Living Assistance and Support Services program  as specified in §355.505 of this chapter (relating to Reimbursement  Methodology for the Community Living Assistance and Support Services  Waiver Program). (12) Step 12. Effective September 1, 2019, the recommended  modeled rates for all TxHmL services except TxHmL CSS are equal to  the rates that were in effect for these services on August 31, 2019.  The recommended modeled rate for TxHmL CSS is calculated as specified  in subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section.  (e) Refinement and adjustment. Refinement/adjustment  of the cost components and model assumptions will be considered, as  appropriate, by HHSC. (f) Total Medicaid Spending Requirement. Effective  for costs and revenues accrued on or after September 1, 2015, through  August 31, 2017, all HCS and TxHmL providers are required to spend  at least 90 percent of revenues received through the HCS and TxHmL  waiver programs' Medicaid payment rates on Medicaid allowable costs  under these programs.

The Texas Health and Human Services  Commission (HHSC) uses the methodology described in this section to  calculate reimbursement for a covered inpatient hospital service. (b) Definitions. (1) Add-on--An amount that is added to the base Standard  Dollar Amount (SDA) to reflect high-cost functions and services or  regional cost differences. (2) Adjudicated--The approval or denial of an inpatient  hospital claim by HHSC.  (3) Base standard dollar amount (base SDA)--A standardized  payment amount calculated by HHSC, as described in subsections (c)  and (d) of this section, for the costs incurred by prospectively paid  hospitals in Texas for furnishing covered inpatient hospital services. (4) Base year--For the purpose of this section, the  base year is a state fiscal year (September through August) to be  determined by HHSC. (5) Base year claims--For the purposes of rate setting  (including Diagnosis-related group (DRG) relative weights, Mean length  of stay (MLOS) and Days Thresholds, and rebasing or realignment of  base rates) effective September 1, 2021, and after HHSC includes Medicaid  inpatient fee-for-service (FFS) and Managed Care Organization (MCO)  encounters that meet the criteria in subparagraphs (A) - (F) of this  paragraph in the Base Year claims data. For base rates set prior to  September 1, 2021, individual sets of base year claims are compiled  for children's hospitals and urban hospitals for the purposes of rate  setting and realignment. All Medicaid inpatient fee-for-service (FFS)  and Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) inpatient hospital claims  for reimbursement filed by an urban or children's hospital that: (A) had a date of admission occurring within the base  year; (B) were adjudicated and approved for payment during  the base year and the six-month grace period that immediately followed  the base year, except for such claims that had zero inpatient days; (C) were not claims for patients who are covered by  Medicare;  (D) were not Medicaid spend-down claims; (E) were not claims associated with military hospitals,  out-of-state hospitals, state-owned teaching hospitals, and freestanding  psychiatric hospitals; and  (F) individual sets of base year claims are compiled  for children's hospitals and urban hospitals for the purposes of rate  setting and rebasing. (6) Children's hospital--A Medicaid hospital designated  by Medicare as a children's hospital and exempted by Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid Services (CMS) from the Medicare prospective payment  system. (7) Cost outlier payment adjustment--A payment adjustment  for a claim with extraordinarily high costs. (8) Cost outlier threshold--One factor used in determining  the cost outlier payment adjustment. (9) Day outlier payment adjustment--A payment adjustment  for a claim with an extended length of stay. (10) Day outlier threshold--One factor used in determining  the day outlier payment adjustment. (11) Diagnosis-related group (DRG)--The classification  of medical diagnoses as defined in the 3MTM All  Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG) system or as otherwise  specified by HHSC. Each DRG has four digits. The last digit of the  Diagnosis-Related Group is the Severity of Illness (SOI). SOI indicates  the seriousness of the condition on a scale of one to four: minor,  moderate, major, or extreme. SOI may increase if secondary diagnoses  are present, in addition to the primary diagnosis. (12) Final settlement--Reconciliation of Medicaid cost  in the CMS form 2552-10 hospital fiscal year end cost report performed  by HHSC within six months after HHSC receives the cost report audited  by a Medicare intermediary, or HHSC. (13) Final standard dollar amount (final SDA)--The  rate assigned to a hospital after HHSC applies the add-ons and other  adjustments described in this section. (14) Geographic wage add-on--An adjustment to a hospital's  base SDA to reflect geographical differences in hospital wage levels.  Hospital geographical areas correspond to the Core-Based Statistical  Areas (CBSAs) established by the federal Office of Management and  Budget in 2003. (15) HHSC--The Texas Health and Human Services Commission,  or its designee.

The term does not apply to payment for costs of providing  services to non-Medicaid-eligible individuals who have third-party  coverage; costs associated with pharmacies, clinics, and physicians;  or costs associated with Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment  projects.  (20) The waiver--The Texas Healthcare Transformation  and Quality Improvement Program, a Medicaid demonstration waiver under §1115  of the Social Security Act that was approved by CMS. Pertinent to  this section, the waiver establishes a funding pool to assist hospitals  with uncompensated-care costs. (21) Third-party coverage--Creditable insurance coverage  consistent with the definitions in 45 Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR) Parts 144 and 146, or coverage based on a legally liable third-party  payor. (22) Total state and local payments--Total amount of  state and local payments that a hospital received for inpatient care  during the data year. The term includes payments under state and local  programs that are funded entirely with state general revenue funds  and state or local tax funds, such as County Indigent Health Care,  Children with Special Health Care Needs, and Kidney Health Care. The  term excludes payment sources that contain federal dollars such as  Medicaid payments, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) payments  funded under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, Substance Abuse  and Mental Health Services Administration, Ryan White Title I, Ryan  White Title II, Ryan White Title III, and contractual discounts and  allowances related to TRICARE, Medicare, and Medicaid. (23) Uncompensated-care waiver payments--Payments to  hospitals participating in the waiver that are intended to defray  the uncompensated costs of eligible services provided to eligible  individuals. (24) Uninsured cost--The cost to a hospital of providing  inpatient and outpatient hospital services to uninsured patients as  defined by CMS. (c) Calculating a state payment cap and hospital-specific  limit. Using information from each hospital's DSH or non-DSH survey,  Medicaid cost report and from HHSC's Medicaid contractors, HHSC will  determine the hospital's state payment cap in compliance with paragraph  (1) of this subsection. The state payment cap will be used for both  DSH and uncompensated care waiver interim payment determinations.  HHSC will determine the hospital's hospital-specific limit in compliance  with paragraph (2) of this subsection. (1) State Payment Cap. (A) Uninsured charges and payments. (i) Each hospital will report in its survey its inpatient  and outpatient charges for services that would be covered by Medicaid  that were provided to uninsured patients discharged during the data  year. In addition to the charges in the previous sentence, for DSH  calculation purposes only, an IMD may report charges for Medicaid-allowable  services that were provided during the data year to Medicaid-eligible  and uninsured patients ages 21 through 64. (ii) Each hospital will report in its survey all payments  received during the data year, regardless of when the service was  provided, for services that would be covered by Medicaid and were  provided to uninsured patients. (I) For purposes of this paragraph, a payment received  is any payment from an uninsured patient or from a third party (other  than an insurer) on the patient's behalf, including payments received  for emergency health services furnished to undocumented aliens under §1011  of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization  Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-173, except as described in subclause  (II) of this clause. (II) State and local payments to hospitals for indigent  care are not included as payments made by or on behalf of uninsured  patients. (B) Medicaid charges and payments. (i) HHSC will request from its Medicaid contractors  the inpatient and outpatient charge and payment data for claims for  services provided to Medicaid-enrolled individuals that are adjudicated  during the data year. (I) The requested data will include, but is not limited  to, charges and payments for: (-a-) claims associated with the care of dually eligible  patients, including Medicare charges and payments; (-b-) claims or portions of claims that were not paid  because they exceeded the spell-of-illness limitation; (-c-) outpatient claims associated with the Women's  Health Program; and (-d-) claims for which the hospital received payment  from a third-party payor for a Medicaid-enrolled patient. (II) HHSC will exclude charges and payments for: (-a-) claims for services that do not meet the definition  of ""medical assistance"" contained in §1905(a) of the Social Security  Act. Examples include: (-1-) claims for the Children's Health Insurance Program;  and (-2-) inpatient claims associated with the Women's  Health Program or any successor program; and (-b-) claims submitted after the 95-day filing deadline. (ii) HHSC will request from its Medicaid contractors  the inpatient and outpatient Medicaid cost settlement payment or recoupment  amounts attributable to the cost report period determined in subparagraph  (C)(i) of this paragraph. (iii) HHSC will notify hospitals following HHSC's receipt  of the requested data from the Medicaid contractors. A hospital's  right to request a review of data it believes is incorrect or incomplete  is addressed in subsection (e) of this section. (iv) Each hospital will report on the survey the inpatient  and outpatient Medicaid days, charges and payment data for out-of-state  claims adjudicated during the data year. (v) HHSC may apply an adjustment factor to Medicaid  payment data to more accurately approximate Medicaid payments following  a rebasing or other change in reimbursement rates under other sections  of this division. (C) Calculation of in-state and out-of-state Medicaid  and uninsured total costs for the data year. (i) Cost report period for data used to calculate cost-per-day  amounts and cost-to-charge ratios. HHSC will use information from  the Medicaid cost report for the hospital's fiscal year that ends  during the calendar year that falls two years before the end of the  program year for the calculations described in clauses (ii)(I) and  (iii)(I) of this subparagraph. For example, for program year 2013,  the cost report year is the provider's fiscal year that ends between  January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. (I) For hospitals that do not have a full year cost  report that meets this criteria, a partial year cost report for the  hospital's fiscal year that ends during the calendar year that falls  two years before the end of the program year will be used if the cost  report covers a period greater than or equal to six months in length. (II) The partial year cost report will not be prorated.  If the provider's cost report that ends during this time period is  less than six months in length, the most recent full year cost report  will be used. (ii) Determining inpatient routine costs. (I) Medicaid inpatient cost per day for routine cost  centers. Using data from the Medicaid cost report, HHSC will divide  the allowable inpatient costs by the inpatient days for each routine  cost center to determine a Medicaid inpatient cost per day for each  routine cost center.

This section establishes the Hospital  Augmented Reimbursement (HARP) Program, wherein the Texas Health and  Human Services Commission (HHSC) directs payments to certain providers  that serve Texas Medicaid fee-for-service patients, including eligible  non-state government owned hospitals, private hospitals, state-owned  hospitals, state government-owned Institutions for Mental Diseases  (IMDs), and private IMDs. This section also describes the methodology  used by HHSC to calculate and administer such payments. A provider  is eligible for a payment under this section only if HHSC has submitted  and CMS has approved a state plan amendment permitting HHSC to make  payments under this section to the hospital class to which the provider  belongs.  (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply when  the terms are used in this section.  (1) Fee-for-Service (FFS)--A system of the health insurance  payment in which a health care provider is paid a fee by HHSC through  the contracted Medicaid claims administrator directly, for each service  rendered. For Texas Medicaid purposes, fee-for-service excludes any  service rendered under a managed care program through a managed care  organization.  (2) Inpatient hospital services--Services ordinarily  furnished in a hospital for the care and treatment of inpatients under  the direction of a physician or dentist, or a subset of these services  identified by HHSC. Inpatient hospital services do not include services  furnished in a skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility  services furnished by a hospital with swing-bed approval, or any other  services that HHSC determines should not be subject to payment.  (3) Intergovernmental transfer (IGT)--A transfer of  public funds from another state agency or a non-state governmental  entity to HHSC.  (4) Medicare payment gap--The difference between what  Medicare is estimated to pay for the services and what Medicaid actually  paid for the same services from the most recent FFS upper payment  limit (UPL) demonstration.  (5) Non-state government-owned and operated hospital--A  hospital that is owned and operated by a local government entity,  including but not limited to a city, county, or hospital district.  (6) Outpatient hospital services--Preventive, diagnostic,  therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services that are furnished  to outpatients of a hospital under the direction of a physician or  dentist, or a subset of these services identified by HHSC.  (7) Private hospital--Any hospital that is not government-owned  and operated.  (8) Private Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD)--A  hospital that is primarily engaged in providing psychiatric diagnosis,  treatment or care of individuals with mental illness and that is not  government-owned and operated.  (9) Program period--Each program period is equal to  a federal fiscal year beginning October 1 and ending September 30  of the following year.  (10) Prospective Payment System--A method of reimbursement  in which payment is made based on a predetermined, fixed amount.  (11) Sponsoring governmental entity--A state or non-state  governmental entity that agrees to transfer to HHSC some or all of  the non-federal share of program expenditures under this subchapter.  (12) State government-owned hospital--Any hospital  owned by the state of Texas that is not considered an IMD.  (13) State government-owned IMD--A hospital that is  primarily engaged in providing psychiatric diagnosis, treatment or  care of individuals with mental illness and that is owned by the state  of Texas that is considered an IMD.  (c) Participation requirements. As a condition of participation,  all hospitals participating in the program must allow for the following.  (1) The hospital must submit a properly completed enrollment  application by the due date determined by HHSC. The enrollment period  must be no less than 15 business days, and the final date of the enrollment  period will be at least nine days prior to the intergovernmental transfer  (IGT) notification.  (2) If a provider has changed ownership in the past  five years in a way that impacts eligibility for this program, the  provider must submit to HHSC, upon demand, copies of contracts it  has with third parties with respect to the transfer of ownership or  the management of the provider and which reference the administration  of, or payment from, this program.  (d) Payments for non-state government-owned and operated  hospitals.  (1) Eligible hospitals. Payments under this subsection  will be limited to hospitals defined as ""non-state government owned  and operated hospital"" that are enrolled in Medicare and participate  in Texas Medicaid fee-for-service.  (2) Non-federal share of program payments. The non-federal  share of the payments is funded through IGTs from sponsoring governmental  entities. No state general revenue is available to support the program.  (A) HHSC will communicate suggested IGT responsibilities.  Suggested IGT responsibilities will be based on the maximum dollars  to be available under the program for the program period as determined  by HHSC. HHSC will also communicate estimated revenues each enrolled  hospital could earn under the program for the program period with  those estimates based on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities.  (B) HHSC will issue an IGT notification to specify  the date that IGT is requested to be transferred not fewer than 14  business days before IGT transfers are due. HHSC may post the IGT  deadlines and other associated information on HHSC's website, send  the information through the established Medicaid notification procedures  used by HHSC's fiscal intermediary, send through other direct mailing,  send through GovDelivery, or provide the information to the hospital  associations to disseminate to their member hospitals.  (3) Payment Methodology. To determine each participating  non-state government-owned and operated hospital's payment under this  section, HHSC will sum the hospital's inpatient FFS Medicare payment  gap and the hospital's outpatient FFS Medicare payment gap.  (e) Payments for private hospitals.  (1) Eligible hospitals. Payments under this subsection  will be limited to hospitals defined as ""private hospital"" in subsection  (b) of this section that are enrolled in Medicare and participate  in Texas Medicaid fee-for-service.

(B) A hospital under this subsection must designate  a single local governmental entity to provide the non-federal share  of the payment through a method determined by HHSC. If the single  local governmental entity transfers less than the full non-federal  share of a hospital's payment amount calculated in any paragraph under  this subchapter, HHSC will recalculate that specific hospital's payment  based on the amount of the non-federal share actually transferred.  (C) HHSC will communicate suggested IGT responsibilities.  Suggested IGT responsibilities will be based on the maximum dollars  to be available under the program for the program period as determined  by HHSC. HHSC will also communicate estimated revenues each enrolled  hospital could earn under the program for the program period with  those estimates based on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities.  (D) HHSC will issue an IGT notification to specify  the date that IGT is requested to be transferred not fewer than 14  business days before IGT transfers are due. HHSC may post the IGT  deadlines and other associated information on HHSC's website, send  the information through the established Medicaid notification procedures  used by HHSC's fiscal intermediary, send through other direct mailing,  send through GovDelivery, or provide the information to the hospital  associations to disseminate to their member hospitals.  (3) Payment Methodology. To determine each participating  private hospital's payment under this section, HHSC will sum the hospital's  inpatient FFS Medicare payment gap and the hospital's outpatient FFS  Medicare payment gap.  (f) Payments for state government-owned hospitals.  (1) Eligible hospitals. Payments under this subsection  will be limited to hospitals defined as ""state government-owned hospital""  in subsection (b) of this section that are enrolled in Medicare and  participate in Texas Medicaid fee-for-service.

(B) A hospital under this subsection must designate  a single local governmental entity to provide the non-federal share  of the payment through a method determined by HHSC. If the single  local governmental entity transfers less than the full non-federal  share of a hospital's payment amount calculated in any paragraph under  this subchapter, HHSC will recalculate that specific hospital's payment  based on the amount of the non-federal share actually transferred.  (C) HHSC will communicate suggested IGT responsibilities.  Suggested IGT responsibilities will be based on the maximum dollars  to be available under the program for the program period as determined  by HHSC. HHSC will also communicate estimated revenues each enrolled  hospital could earn under the program for the program period with  those estimates based on HHSC's suggested IGT responsibilities.  (D) HHSC will issue an IGT notification to specify  the date that IGT is requested to be transferred not fewer than 14  business days before IGT transfers are due. HHSC will publish the  IGT deadlines and all associated dates on its Internet website.  (3) Payment Methodology. (A) To determine payment under this section for each  participating state-owned hospital reimbursed through Prospective  Payment System (PPS), HHSC will sum the hospital's inpatient FFS Medicare  payment gap and the hospital's outpatient FFS Medicare payment gap.

Rural health clinics (RHCs) employing the Prospective Payment System (PPS) methodology, in accordance with section 1902(bb) of the Social Security Act as amended by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (42 U.S.C. §1396a(bb)), will be reimbursed a prospective rate for Medicaid covered services. The Alternative Prospective Payment System (APPS) methodology is an option through August 31, 2010. Starting September 1, 2010, all RHCs will be reimbursed using the PPS methodology as described in this section. RHCs are reimbursed a prospective per visit encounter rate for a visit that meets the requirements of subsections (o) and (p) of this section. (b) The final base rate for both hospital-based and freestanding RHCs existing in 2000 was calculated based on one hundred percent (100%) of the average of the RHC's reasonable costs for providing Medicaid covered services as determined from audited cost reports for the RHC's 1999 and 2000 fiscal years. The final base rates were calculated by adding the total audited reimbursable costs as determined from the 1999 and 2000 cost reports and dividing by the total audited visits for these same two periods. In the event an audited cost report was not received from the Medicare Intermediary, the final base rate for both hospital-based and freestanding RHCs was calculated based on one hundred percent (100%) of the average of the RHC's reasonable costs for providing Medicaid covered services as determined from audited or unaudited cost reports for the RHC's 1999 and 2000 fiscal years. (c) For hospital-based RHCs existing in 2000, an interim base rate for each RHC was calculated from the latest finalized cost report settlement, adjusted as provided for in subsection (l) of this section. For freestanding RHCs existing in 2000, the interim base rate for each RHC was based upon the per visit rate in the Medicaid payment system as of December 31, 2000, adjusted as provided for in subsection (l) of this section. When the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) determined a final base rate, interim payments were reconciled back to January 1, 2001. For RHCs that agreed to the APPS methodology prior to August 31, 2010, adjustments were made to the RHCs' interim rates only if the interim payments were less than what would have occurred under the final base rate. Subsection (k) of this section contains the interim and final base rate methodology for new RHCs. (d) Reasonable costs, as used in setting the interim or final base rate, or any subsequent effective rate, is defined as those costs that are allowable under Medicare Cost Principles as outlined in 42 CFR part 413. The cost limits that were in place on December 31, 2000, shall be maintained in determining reasonable costs. Reasonable costs do not include unallowable costs. (e) Unallowable costs are expenses that are incurred by an RHC and that are not directly or indirectly related to the provision of covered services, according to applicable laws, rules, and standards. An RHC may expend funds on unallowable cost items, but those costs must not be included in the cost report/survey, and they are not used in calculating an interim or final base rate determination. Unallowable costs include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: (1) compensation in the form of salaries, benefits, or any form of compensation given to individuals who are not directly or indirectly related to the provision of covered services; (2) personal expenses not directly related to the provision of covered services; (3) management fees or indirect costs that are not derived from the actual cost of materials, supplies, or services necessary for the delivery of covered services, unless the operational need and cost effectiveness can be demonstrated; (4) advertising expenses other than those for advertising in the telephone directory yellow pages, for employee or contract labor recruitment, and for meeting any statutory or regulatory requirement; (5) business expenses not directly related to the provision of covered services. For example, expenses associated with the sale or purchase of a business or expenses associated with the sale or purchase of investments; (6) political contributions; (7) depreciation and amortization of unallowable costs, including amounts in excess of those resulting from the straight line depreciation method; capitalized lease expenses, less any maintenance expenses, in excess of the actual lease payment; and goodwill or any excess above the actual value of the physical assets at the time of purchase. Regarding the purchase of a business, the depreciable basis will be the lesser of the historical but not depreciated cost to the previous owner or the purchase price of the assets. Any depreciation in excess of this amount is unallowable; (8) trade discounts and allowances of all types, including returns, allowances, and refunds received on purchases of goods or services. These are reductions of costs to which they relate and thus, by reference, are unallowable; (9) donated facilities, materials, supplies, and services including the values assigned to the services of unpaid workers and volunteers whether directly or indirectly related to covered services, except as permitted in 42 CFR Part 413; (10) dues to all types of political and social organizations, and to professional associations whose functions and purpose are not reasonably related to the development and operation of patient care facilities and programs, or the rendering of patient care services; (11) entertainment expenses except those incurred for entertainment provided to the staff of the RHC as an employee benefit. An example of entertainment expenses is lunch during the provision of continuing medical education on-site; (12) board of directors' fees, including travel costs and meals provided for these directors; (13) fines and penalties for violations of statutes, regulations, and ordinances of all types; (14) fund raising and promotional expenses, except as noted in paragraph (4) of this subsection; (15) interest expenses on loans pertaining to unallowable items, such as investments. Also the interest expense on that portion of interest paid that is reduced or offset by interest income; (16) insurance premiums pertaining to items of unallowable cost; (17) any accrued expenses that are not a legal obligation of the provider or are not clearly enumerated as to dollar amount; (18) mileage expense exceeding the current reimbursement rate set by the federal government for its employee travel; (19) cost for goods or services that are purchased from a related party and which exceed the original cost to the related party; (20) out-of-state travel expenses not related to the provision of covered services, except out-of-state travel expenses for training courses that increase the quality of medical care and/or the operating efficiency of the RHC; (21) over-funding contributions to self-insurance funds that do not represent payments based on current liabilities. (f) Increases in an RHC's final base rate or the effective rate shall be the rate of change in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) for Primary Care. (g) The effective rate is the rate paid to the RHC for the RHC's fiscal year. The effective rate equals the final base rate plus the MEI for each of the RHC's fiscal years since the setting of its final base rate. The effective rate shall be calculated at the start of each RHC's fiscal year and shall be applied prospectively for that fiscal year. (h) It is the intent of the state to ensure that each RHC is reimbursed at one hundred percent (100%) of its reasonable costs or the Medicare maximum payment per visit (federal ceiling) as applicable. An adjustment shall be made to the effective rate if the RHC can show that an increase is due to a change in scope as defined in subsection (i)(1) - (6) of this section. An RHC may request an adjustment of the effective rate equal to one hundred percent (100%) of reasonable costs by submitting a cost report to HHSC and including the necessary documentation to support a claim that the RHC has undergone a change in scope. A cost report, filed to request an adjustment in the effective rate, may be filed at any time during an RHC's fiscal year but no later than five (5) calendar months after the end of the RHC's fiscal year. All requests for adjustment in the RHC's effective rate must include at least 6 months of financial data. Any effective rate adjustment granted as a result of such a filing must be completed within sixty (60) days of receipt of a workable cost report and documentation supporting the RHC's claim that it has undergone a change in scope. Within sixty (60) days of receiving a workable cost report, HHSC or its designee shall make a determination regarding a new effective rate. When HHSC determines a final base rate, interim payments will be reconciled back to the beginning of the interim period. If the final base rate is greater than the interim base rate, HHSC will compute and pay the RHC a settlement payment that represents the difference in rates for the services provided during the interim period. If the final base rate is less than the interim base rate, HHSC will compute and recover from the RHC a recoupment payment that represents the difference in rates for the services provided during the interim period. HHSC also may adjust the effective rate of an RHC on its own initiative if it is determined that a change in scope has occurred and an adjustment to the effective rate is warranted based on the audit of the cost report defined in subsection (l) of this section. The new effective rate shall become effective the first day of the month immediately following its determination and shall not be applied retroactively (i) Any request to adjust an effective rate must be accompanied by documentation showing that the RHC has had a change in scope. A change in scope of services provided by an RHC includes the addition or deletion of a service or a change in the magnitude, intensity, or character of services currently offered by an RHC or one of the RHC's sites. A change in scope includes: (1) an increase in service intensity attributable to changes in the types of patients served, including but not limited to, patients with HIV/AIDS, the homeless, the elderly, migrants, those with other chronic diseases or special populations; (2) any changes in services or provider mix provided by an RHC or one of its sites; (3) changes in operating costs that have occurred during the fiscal year and which are attributable to capital expenditures, including new service facilities or regulatory compliance; (4) changes in operating costs attributable to changes in technology or medical practices at the RHC; (5) indirect medical education adjustment and a direct graduate medical education payment that reflects the costs of providing teaching services to interns and residents; or (6) any changes in scope approved by the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA). (j) A complete and workable cost report includes the following: (1) for a hospital-based RHC, complete HCFA Form 2552 and HCFA Form 339 with certification by an officer or administrator certifying the accuracy of the attached data including: (A) M-1 (analysis of provider-based RHC costs); (B) M-2 (allocation of overhead to RHC services); (C) M-3 (calculation of reimbursement settlement for RHC services); (D) M-5 (analysis of payments to hospital-based RHC services rendered to program beneficiaries); (E) S-8 (statistical data/information purposes); (F) RHC net expenses for allocation of costs for services rendered on or after January 1, 1998, reported on the hospital's worksheet A, column 7 traced properly to the RHC's total facility costs on line 32, column 7 on M-1 worksheet; and (G) hospital's overhead worksheet expenses allocated to each of the hospital-based RHC cost centers on worksheet B, Part I (column 27 minus column 0) traced properly to line 15, column 5 on M-2 worksheet for each hospital-based RHC. (2) for a freestanding RHC, a complete and accurate HCFA 222 Form and HCFA 339 Form with certification by an officer or administrator. (k) Once the final base rate for an RHC has been calculated, the RHC will be paid its effective rate without the need to file a cost report unless requested by HHSC. A cost report will be required if the RHC is seeking to adjust its effective rate as an RHC or the state may request, on a periodic basis, that an RHC file a cost report for its most current fiscal year, within five (5) months of notification by HHSC or its designee. HHSC or its designee may delay or withhold vendor payment to a provider upon failure to submit a requested cost report until a complete and workable cost report has been received by HHSC or its designee. (l) New RHCs will file a projected cost report within 90 days of their designation as an RHC to establish an interim base rate. The cost report will contain the RHC's reasonable costs anticipated to be incurred during the RHC's initial fiscal year. The interim base rate will be set at 80% of the anticipated reasonable costs for hospital-based RHCs with 50 beds or less. New freestanding RHCs and new hospital-based RHCs with more than 50 beds will have interim base rates set at the lesser of their anticipated reasonable costs or the Medicare maximum payment rate (federal ceiling). Any new RHC opting not to file a projected cost report will have its interim base rate set at 75% of the federal ceiling. Each RHC must file a cost report with HHSC or its designee within five (5) months of the end of the RHC's initial fiscal Cont'd..."

A physician group practice is eligible  to receive payments under this section if: (1) it is enrolled as a Medicaid provider in the State  of Texas at the beginning of the demonstration year; (2) it has a source of IGT as the non-federal share  of the payments; (3) for a private physician group practice only, it  has met the submission requirements set forth in §355.8201(c)(1)(B)(iii)  of this title, only insofar as that clause relates to certifications,  and it files documents with HHSC by the date specified by HHSC, certifying  that: (A) all funds transferred to HHSC as the non-federal  share of the waiver payments are public funds; and (B) no part of any payment received by the physician  group practice under this section will be returned to the governmental  entity that transferred to HHSC the non-federal share of the waiver  payments; (4) it has submitted to HHSC an acceptable uncompensated-care  physician application for the demonstration year by the deadline specified  by HHSC; and (5) it has submitted, and is eligible to receive payment  for, a Medicaid fee-for-service or managed-care claim for payment  during the demonstration year and either: (A) it received a supplemental payment under the Texas  Medicaid State Plan for claims adjudicated in one or more months between  October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011; or (B) it is the successor in a contract to a physician  group practice that received a supplemental payment under the Texas  Medicaid State Plan for claims adjudicated in one or more months between  October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011. (6) A physician group practice that fails to submit  the required documentation in compliance with this subsection will  not receive a payment under this section. (d) Source of funding. (1) The non-federal share of funding for payments under  this section is limited to and obtained through an IGT from the governmental  entity that owns or is affiliated with the physician group practice  receiving the payment. (2) An IGT that is not received by the date specified  by HHSC may not be accepted.  (e) Payment frequency. HHSC will distribute waiver  payments on a schedule to be determined by HHSC and posted on HHSC's  website. (f) Funding limitations. (1) Payments made under this section are limited by  the maximum aggregate amount of funds allocated to the physician group  practice uncompensated-care pool for the demonstration year as described  in §355.8201 of this title. If payments for uncompensated care  for the physician group practice uncompensated-care pool attributable  to a demonstration year are expected to exceed the aggregate amount  of funds allocated to that pool by HHSC for that demonstration year,  HHSC will reduce payments to providers in the pool as described in  subsection (g)(4) of this section. (2) Payments made under this section are limited by  the availability of funds identified in subsection (d) of this section.  If sufficient funds are not available for all payments for which a  physician group practice is eligible, HHSC will reduce payments as  described in subsection (h)(2) of this section. (g) Uncompensated-care payment amount. (1) Uncompensated-care physician application. Payments  to eligible physician group practices are based on cost and payment  data reported by the physician group practice on an application form  prescribed by HHSC. (A) Cost and payment data reported by the physician  group practice in the uncompensated-care physician application is  used to: (i) calculate the annual maximum uncompensated-care  payment amount for the applicable demonstration year, as described  in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and (ii) reconcile the actual uncompensated-care costs  reported by the physician group practice for a prior period with uncompensated-care  waiver payments, if any, made to the practice for the same period.  The reconciliation process is more fully described in subsection (j)  of this section. (B) Unless otherwise instructed in the uncompensated-care  physician application: (i) the cost and payment data reported in the uncompensated-care  physician application must be consistent with Medicare cost-reporting  principles and must comply with the application instructions or other  guidance issued by HHSC, and the physician group practice must maintain  sufficient documentation to support the reported data or information;  and (ii) the costs associated with an episode of care where  a physician group practice is paid under contract must be reduced  by any revenues associated with that episode of care prior to inclusion  in the uncompensated-care physician application. (C) If a physician group practice withdraws from participation  in the waiver, the practice must submit an uncompensated-care application  reporting its actual costs and payments for any period during which  the practice received uncompensated-care payments. The uncompensated-care  physician application will be used for the purpose described in subparagraph  (A)(ii) of this paragraph. If a practice fails to submit the application  reporting its actual costs, HHSC will recoup the full amount of uncompensated-care  payments to the practice for the period at issue. (2) Calculation. A physician group practice's annual  maximum uncompensated-care payment amount is the sum of the following  components: (A) Its unreimbursed uninsured costs and Medicaid shortfall,  as reported on the uncompensated-care physician application; and (B) Cost and payment adjustments, if any, as described  in paragraph (3) of this subsection. (3) Adjustments. When submitting the uncompensated-care  physician application, physician group practices may request that  cost and payment data from the reporting period be adjusted to reflect  increases or decreases in costs resulting from changes in operations  or circumstances. (A) A physician group practice may request that: (i) Costs not reflected on the financial documents  supporting the application, but which would be incurred for the demonstration  year, be included when calculating payment amounts; or (ii) Costs reflected on the financial documents supporting  the application, but which would not be incurred for the demonstration  year, be excluded when calculating payment amounts. (B) Documentation supporting the request must accompany  the application. HHSC will deny a request if it cannot verify that  costs not reflected on the financial documents supporting the application  will be incurred for the demonstration year. (4) Reduction to stay within physician group practice  uncompensated-care pool aggregate limits. Prior to processing uncompensated-care  payments for any payment period within a waiver demonstration year  for the physician group practice uncompensated-care pool described  in §355.8201 of this title, HHSC will determine if such a payment  would cause total uncompensated-care payments for the demonstration  year for the pool to exceed the aggregate limit for the pool and will  reduce the maximum uncompensated-care payment amounts providers in  the pool are eligible to receive for that period as required to remain  within the pool aggregate limit. (A) Calculations in this paragraph are limited to the  physician group practice uncompensated-care pool. (B) HHSC will calculate the following data points: (i) For each provider, prior period payments to equal  prior period uncompensated-care for the demonstration year. (ii) For each provider, a maximum uncompensated-care  payment for the payment period to equal the sum of: (I) the portion of the annual maximum uncompensated-care  payment amount calculated for that provider (as described in this  section) that is attributable to the payment period; and (II) the difference, if any, between the portions of  the annual maximum uncompensated-care payment amounts attributable  to prior periods and the prior period payments calculated in clause  (i) of this subparagraph. (iii) The cumulative maximum payment amount to equal  the sum of prior period payments from clause (i) of this subparagraph  and the maximum uncompensated-care payment for the payment period  from clause (ii) of this subparagraph for all members of the pool  combined. (iv) A pool-wide total maximum uncompensated-care payment  for the demonstration year to equal the sum of all pool member's annual  maximum uncompensated-care payment amounts for the demonstration year  from paragraph (2) of this subsection. (v) A pool-wide ratio calculated as the pool aggregate  limit from §355.8201 of this title divided by the pool-wide total  maximum uncompensated-care payment amount for the demonstration year  from clause (iv) of this subparagraph.

(2) Payments made under this section are limited by  the availability of funds identified in subsection (d) of this section.  If sufficient funds are not available for all payments for which all  physician group practices are eligible, HHSC will reduce payments  as described in subsection (h)(2) of this section.  (g) Uncompensated-care payment amount.  (1) Uncompensated-care physician application. Payments  to eligible physician group practices are based on cost and payment  data reported by the physician group practice on an application form  prescribed by HHSC.  (A) Cost and payment data reported by the physician  group practice in the uncompensated-care physician application is  used to:  (i) calculate the annual maximum uncompensated-care  payment amount for the applicable demonstration year, as described  in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and  (ii) reconcile the actual uncompensated-care costs  reported by the physician group practice for a prior period with uncompensated-care  waiver payments, if any, made to the practice for the same period.  The reconciliation process is more fully described in subsection (j)  of this section.  (B) Unless otherwise instructed in the uncompensated-care  physician application:  (i) the cost and payment data reported in the uncompensated-care  physician application must be consistent with Medicare cost-reporting  principles and must comply with the application instructions or other  guidance issued by HHSC, and the physician group practice must maintain  sufficient documentation to support the reported data or information;  and  (ii) the costs associated with an episode of care where  a physician group practice is paid under contract must be reduced  by any revenues associated with that episode of care prior to inclusion  in the uncompensated-care physician application.  (C) If a physician group practice withdraws from participation  in the waiver, the practice must submit an uncompensated-care application  reporting its actual costs and payments for any period during which  the practice received uncompensated-care payments. The uncompensated-care  physician application will be used for the purpose described in subparagraph  (A)(ii) of this paragraph. If a practice fails to submit the application  reporting its actual costs, HHSC will recoup the full amount of uncompensated-care  payments to the practice for the period at issue.  (2) Calculation. A physician group practice's annual  maximum uncompensated-care payment amount is the sum of the following  components:  (A) its unreimbursed charity-care costs, as reported  on the uncompensated-care physician application; and  (B) cost and payment adjustments, if any, as described  in paragraph (3) of this subsection.  (3) Adjustments. When submitting the uncompensated-care  physician application, physician group practices may request that  cost and payment data from the reporting period be adjusted to reflect  increases or decreases in costs resulting from changes in operations  or circumstances.  (A) A physician group practice may request that:  (i) costs not reflected on the financial documents  supporting the application, but which would be incurred for the demonstration  year, be included when calculating payment amounts; or  (ii) costs reflected on the financial documents supporting  the application, but which would not be incurred for the demonstration  year, be excluded when calculating payment amounts.  (B) Documentation supporting the request must accompany  the application, and provide sufficient information for HHSC to verify  the link between the changes to the provider's operations or circumstances  and the specified numbers used to calculate the amount of the adjustment. (i) Such supporting documentation must include:  (I) a detailed description of the specific changes  to the provider's operations or circumstances; (II) verifiable information from the provider's general  ledger, financial statements, patient accounting records or other  relevant sources that support the numbers used to calculate the adjustment;  and (III) if applicable, a copy of any relevant contracts,  financial assistance policies or other policies/procedures that verify  the change to the provider's operations or circumstances.  (ii) HHSC will deny a request if it cannot verify that  costs not reflected on the financial documents supporting the application  will be incurred for the demonstration year.  (4) Reduction to stay within physician group practice  uncompensated-care pool allocation amount. Prior to processing uncompensated-care  payments for any payment period within a waiver demonstration year  for the physician group practice uncompensated-care pool described  in §355.8212 of this division, HHSC will determine if such a  payment would cause total uncompensated-care payments for the demonstration  year for the pool to exceed the allocation amount for the pool and  will reduce the maximum uncompensated-care payment amounts providers  in the pool are eligible to receive for that period as required to  remain within the pool allocation amount.  (A) Calculations in this paragraph are limited to the  physician group practice uncompensated-care pool.  (B) HHSC will calculate the following data points:  (i) for each provider, prior period payments to equal  prior period uncompensated-care for the demonstration year;  (ii) for each provider, a maximum uncompensated-care  payment for the payment period to equal the sum of:  (I) the portion of the annual maximum uncompensated-care  payment amount calculated for that provider (as described in this  section) that is attributable to the payment period; and  Cont'd..."

Federally  Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) selecting the PPS methodology, in  accordance with section 1902(bb) of the Social Security Act, as amended  by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (42  U.S.C. §1396a(bb)), effective for the FQHC's fiscal year that  includes dates of service occurring January 1, 2001, and after, will  be reimbursed a PPS per visit encounter rate for Medicaid covered  services. FQHCs are reimbursed a prospective per visit encounter rate  for a visit that meets the requirements of subsections (b)(12) and  (13) of this section. The final base rate for each FQHC existing in  2000 was calculated based on one hundred percent (100%) of the average  of the FQHC's reasonable costs for providing Medicaid covered services  as determined from audited cost reports for the FQHC's 1999 and 2000  fiscal years. The final base rate was calculated by adding the total  audited reimbursable costs as determined from the 1999 and 2000 cost  reports and dividing by the total audited visits for these same two  periods. The reimbursement methodologies described in subsection (b)  of this section apply to the PPS methodology, except for the following: (1) The effective rate for APPS described in subsection  (b)(4) of this section does not apply to PPS. Increases in the final  base rate or the effective rate for a PPS-reimbursed FQHC shall be  the rate of change in the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) for primary  care. If the increase in an FQHC's costs is greater than the MEI for  PPS, an FQHC may request an adjustment of its effective rate as described  in subsection (b)(6) of this section. (2) State initiated reviews, described in subsection  (b)(10)(D) of this section, are not applicable for providers who select  the PPS methodology. (b) Alternative Prospective Payment System (APPS) Methodology.  FQHCs selecting the APPS methodology, in accordance with section 1902(bb)  of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Benefits Improvement  and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (42 U.S.C. §1396a(bb)), effective  for the FQHC's fiscal year that includes dates of service occurring  January 1, 2001, and after, are reimbursed an APPS per visit encounter  rate for Medicaid covered services at one hundred percent (100%) of  reasonable costs. FQHCs are reimbursed a prospective per visit encounter  rate for a visit that meets the requirements of paragraphs (12) and  (13) of this subsection. The final base rate for each FQHC existing  in 2000 was calculated based on one hundred percent (100%) of the  average of the FQHC's reasonable costs for providing Medicaid covered  services as determined from audited cost reports for the FQHC's 1999  and 2000 fiscal years. The final base rate was calculated by adding  the total audited reimbursable costs as determined from the 1999 and  2000 cost reports and dividing by the total audited visits for these  same two periods. (1) Prior to the Health and Human Services Commission  (HHSC) setting a final base rate pursuant to this section for each  FQHC existing in 2000, each FQHC was reimbursed on the basis of an  interim base rate. The interim base rate for each FQHC was calculated  from the latest finalized cost report settlement, adjusted as provided  for in paragraph (4) of this subsection. When HHSC determined a final  base rate, interim payments were reconciled back to the beginning  of the interim period. For FQHCs that agreed to the APPS methodology  prior to August 31, 2010, adjustments were made to the FQHC's interim  payments only if the interim payments were less than what would have  occurred under the final base rate. Paragraph (10) of this subsection  contains the interim and final base rate methodology for new FQHCs.  The final base rate, as adjusted, applies prospectively from the date  of the final approval. Payments made under the APPS methodology will  be at least equal to the amount that would be paid under PPS. (2) Reasonable costs, as used in setting the interim  or final base rate or any subsequent effective rate, is defined as  those costs that are allowable under Medicare Cost Principles, as  outlined in 42 C.F.R. part 413, with no productivity screens and no  per visit payment limit. Administrative costs will be limited to thirty  percent (30%) of total costs in determining reasonable costs. Reasonable  costs do not include unallowable costs. (3) Unallowable costs are expenses that are incurred  by an FQHC and that are not directly or indirectly related to the  provision of covered services, according to applicable laws, rules,  and standards. An FQHC may expend funds on unallowable cost items,  but those costs must not be included in the cost report/survey, and  they are not used in calculating an interim or final base rate determination.  Unallowable costs include, but are not necessarily limited to, the  following: (A) compensation in the form of salaries, benefits,  or any form of compensation given to individuals who are not directly  or indirectly related to the provision of covered services; (B) personal expenses not directly related to the provision  of covered services; (C) management fees or indirect costs that are not  derived from the actual cost of materials, supplies, or services necessary  for the delivery of covered services, unless the operational need  and cost effectiveness can be demonstrated; (D) advertising expenses other than those for advertising  in the telephone directory yellow pages, for employee or contract  labor recruitment, and for meeting any statutory or regulatory requirement; (E) business expenses not directly related to the provision  of covered services. For example, expenses associated with the sale  or purchase of a business or expenses associated with the sale or  purchase of investments; (F) political contributions; (G) depreciation and amortization of unallowable costs,  including amounts in excess of those resulting from the straight line  depreciation method; capitalized lease expenses, less any maintenance  expenses, in excess of the actual lease payment; and goodwill or any  excess above the actual value of the physical assets at the time of  purchase. Regarding the purchase of a business, the depreciable basis  will be the lesser of the historical but not depreciated cost to the  previous owner or the purchase price of the assets. Any depreciation  in excess of this amount is unallowable; (H) trade discounts and allowances of all types, including  returns, allowances, and refunds, received on purchases of goods or  services. These are reductions of costs to which they relate and thus,  by reference, are unallowable; (I) donated facilities, materials, supplies, and services  including the values assigned to the services of unpaid workers and  volunteers whether directly or indirectly related to covered services,  except as permitted in 42 C.F.R. part 413; (J) dues to all types of political and social organizations  and to professional associations whose functions and purpose are not  reasonably related to the development and operation of patient care  facilities and programs or the rendering of patient care services; (K) entertainment expenses, except those incurred for  entertainment provided to the staff of the FQHC as an employee benefit.  An example of entertainment expenses is lunch during the provision  of continuing medical education on-site; (L) board of director's fees, including travel costs  and meals provided for directors; (M) fines and penalties for violations of statutes,  regulations, and ordinances of all types; (N) fund raising and promotional expenses, except as  noted in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph; (O) interest expenses on loans pertaining to unallowable  items, such as investments. Also the interest expense on that portion  of interest paid that is reduced or offset by interest income; (P) insurance premiums pertaining to items of unallowable  costs; (Q) any accrued expenses that are not a legal obligation  of the provider or are not clearly enumerated as to dollar amount; (R) mileage expense exceeding the current reimbursement  rate set by the federal government for its employee travel; (S) cost for goods or services that are purchased from  a related party and that exceed the original cost to the related party; (T) out-of-state travel expenses not related to the  provision of covered services, except out-of-state travel expenses  for training courses that increase the quality of medical care and/or  the operating efficiency of the FQHC; (U) over-funding contributions to self-insurance funds  that do not represent payments based on current liabilities; (V) overhead costs beyond the thirty percent (30%)  limitation established by HHSC. (4) The effective rate for APPS - The effective rate  is the rate paid to the FQHC for the FQHC's fiscal year. The effective  rate shall be updated by the rate of change in the MEI plus (0.5)  percent for each of the FQHC's fiscal years since the setting of its  final base rate. If the increase in an FQHC's costs is greater than  the MEI plus (0.5) percent for APPS, an FQHC may request an adjustment  of its effective rate as described in paragraph (6) of this subsection.  The effective rate shall be calculated at the start of each FQHC's  fiscal year and shall be applied prospectively for that fiscal year.  The effective rate for PPS is described in subsection (a)(1) of this  section. (5) PPS and APPS reimbursement methodology selection  is determined as follows: (A) Each new in-state FQHC will receive a letter from  HHSC upon enrollment as a new provider along with the Federally Qualified  Health Centers (FQHC) Prospective Payment System Form. This form must  be signed by an authorized representative and returned to HHSC within  thirty (30) days of the enrollment letter date. The form must indicate  the selection as either the PPS or APPS reimbursement methodology.  If HHSC does not receive the form within the specified time requirement,  HHSC will select the PPS reimbursement methodology for this provider.  For a provider that fails to return the form selecting the APPS reimbursement  methodology, the provider may submit a written request along with  the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) Prospective Payment  System Form selecting the APPS reimbursement methodology. Upon approval  by HHSC, the new selection will be effective the first day of the  provider's next fiscal year. (B) Each out-of-state FQHCs will receive the PPS reimbursement  methodology. Out-of-state FQHCs may not select the APPS reimbursement  methodology. HHSC will compute an effective rate based on reasonable  costs provided by the FQHC on its most recent Medicare cost report,  pursuant to paragraph (8)(A) and (B) of this subsection. The effective  rate will reflect the rate that would have been calculated for an  in-state FQHC based on the approved scope of services that an in-state  FQHC could provide in Texas. (C) When HHSC makes a change to the PPS or APPS reimbursement  methodology, HHSC may require FQHCs to reselect the PPS or APPS reimbursement  methodology, in accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (A)  of this paragraph. (6) A change of the effective rate is determined as  follows: (A) An adjustment, as described in paragraph (10)(C)  of this subsection, will be made to the effective rate if the FQHC  can show that it is operating in an efficient manner as defined in  paragraph (7)(B) of this subsection, or show that the adjustment is  warranted due to a change in scope as defined in paragraph (7)(A)  of this subsection. (B) HHSC also may adjust the effective rate of an FQHC  on its own initiative, in accordance with paragraph (10)(D) of this  subsection, if it is determined that a change of scope has occurred  and an adjustment to the effective rate as defined in paragraph (7)  of this subsection is warranted based on the audit of the cost report  described in paragraph (8)(C) of this subsection. (7) Any request to adjust an effective rate must be  accompanied by documentation showing that the FQHC is operating in  an efficient manner or that it has had a change in scope. A change  in scope provided by an FQHC includes the addition or deletion of  a service or a change in the magnitude, intensity or character of  services currently offered by an FQHC or one of the FQHC's sites. (A) A change in scope includes: (i) an increase in service intensity attributable to  changes in the types of patients served, including but not limited  to, patients with HIV/AIDS, the homeless, the elderly, migrants, those  with other chronic diseases or special populations; (ii) any changes in services or provider mix provided  by an FQHC or one of its sites; (iii) changes in operating costs that have occurred  during the fiscal year and which are attributable to capital expenditures,  including new service facilities or regulatory compliance; (iv) changes in operating costs attributable to changes  in technology or medical practices at the FQHC; (v) indirect medical education adjustments and a direct  graduate medical education payment that reflects the costs of providing  teaching services to interns and residents; or (vi) any changes in scope approved by the Health Resources  and Service Administration (HRSA). (B) Operating in an efficient manner includes: Cont'd..."

This section implements the provisions of Senate Bill 79, 73rd Texas Legislature, 1993, mandating selective contracting for non-emergency inpatient hospital services. (b) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. (1) Market area--A geographic subdivision of the State of Texas defined as a group of geographically contiguous counties in which the Texas Department of Health (department) determines that health care providers will be invited to apply for selective contracting agreements. In general, each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the State will be considered for designation as a market area. Where warranted by historical patient migration patterns, the department may designate certain non-MSA counties that are geographically contiguous to an MSA to be included with MSA counties within a market area. (2) Effective service area--For each health care provider in a market area, the geographic area, as defined on a zip code basis, in which the health care provider has historically provided inpatient hospital services to Medicaid patients. For purposes of subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the effective service area will be determined based on historical Medicaid inpatient claims data. (3) Executive Oversight Committee--The executive committee established by the department to direct the selective contracting initiative. (4) Hospital capacity to provide specialized service offerings-- (A) For the LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program I, the presence or absence of specific acute care hospital services, including, but not limited to, trauma centers, burn units, neonatal intensive care unit services, and psychiatric services, that are required to be available in the market to ensure adequate access to quality care. (B) For the LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program II, the presence or absence of specific inpatient psychiatric services, including, but not limited to, separate units for young children and adolescents, separate psychiatric and substance abuse treatment services, closed and open units, and distinct programs (e.g., dual diagnosis, eating disorder) that may be required to be available in the market to ensure adequate access to quality. (5) New facility--A health care provider facility substantially constructed after the time the department determined the network of health care providers that would be contracted under selective provider agreements. Such term shall not include facilities that were built and operational at the time the department determined the network of selective providers for the affected market area; regardless of whether the facility's corporate structure and/or name have changed due to merger, acquisition, or other corporate reorganization. (6) Potential network--Any combination of applicant health care providers (whether the result of a joint proposal or determined by the department) that offer a: (A) combined effective service area that provides geographic coverage of the market area to the same extent that coverage is provided under current practice; (B) combined service capacity equal to at least: (i) 115% of the most recently available historic service volume experience for the market area for the LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program I; or (ii) 125% of the most recently available historic service volume experience for the market area for the LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program II; and (C) combination of specialized services available within the market area that is at least as broad as the range of specialized services presently available to Medicaid recipients in that market area. (7) Selective contracting--A method of contracting, granted through waivers of certain provisions of the Social Security Act, that allows the department to contract selectively with health care providers for non-emergency inpatient services, thereby improving its ability to act as a prudent purchaser of services and to manage the Medical Assistance Program in a more effective and efficient manner, as required by Senate Bill 79. (8) Selective provider agreement--An agreement which includes an amendment to a health care provider's existing provider agreement with the department and involves selective contracting. (9) Disproportionate share hospital--A health care provider participating in the Medicaid program that, according to state Medicaid criteria, meets the conditions of participation and serves a disproportionate share of indigent patients. Additional requirements for disproportionate share hospitals are specified in §29.609 of this title (relating to Additional Reimbursement to Disproportionate Share Hospitals) and §29.610 of this title (relating to Disproportionate Share Hospital Reimbursement Methodology for State-Owned Teaching Hospitals). (10) Health care provider-- (A) any acute care hospital that is eligible to provide inpatient hospital services to Medicaid recipients; or (B) any inpatient mental health facility, as defined within this section. (11) Optional volume management activities--Those activities that acute care hospitals may propose to furnish to Medicaid recipients in a market area to expand access to primary care services and ensure more appropriate use of acute care hospital facilities. Such activities may include, but not be limited to, furnishing ambulatory primary care clinic services to Medicaid recipients, and furnishing nurse hotlines which Medicaid recipients may call to receive professional advice about the most appropriate means to obtain medical care. (12) Hardship exemption procedure--A method for non-contracted health care providers to obtain prior authorization from the department to provide non-emergency inpatient services to Medicaid recipients who would experience an unreasonable travel burden under the LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program(s). (13) Emergency inpatient services--An admission into a health care provider with a diagnosis meeting the definition of a medical emergency. (14) Non-emergency inpatient services--An admission into a health care provider with a diagnosis not meeting the definition of a medical emergency. (15) LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program I--The selective contracting program designed and implemented for acute care hospitals. (16) LoneSTAR Select Contracting Program II--The selective contracting program designed and implemented for inpatient mental health facilities as defined in the Health and Safety Code, §571.003. (17) Inpatient mental health facility--A mental health facility that can provide 24-hour residential and acute inpatient psychiatric services that is: (A) a facility operated by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation; (B) a private mental hospital licensed by the department; (C) a community center; (D) a facility operated by a community center or other entity the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation designates to provide mental health services; (E) an identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis, treatment, and care for persons with mental illness is provided and that is licensed by the department; or (F) a hospital operated by a federal agency. (c) General design. The department shall select that subset of market areas that appears to indicate the most effective competition for selective provider agreements to serve Medicaid patients. The market areas shall be divided into one or more groups of solicitations that will avoid an overlap of contract evaluation and negotiation of solicitations. (1) The department shall implement selective contracting by executing amendments to each health care provider's existing provider agreement with the department. Health care providers that were not parties to provider agreements before implementation of the department's selective contracting are eligible to apply; however, they must enter into a provider agreement that ensures they are subject to all terms and conditions of the Medical Assistance Program. The amendments to the provider agreements, and the process by which the department solicited, evaluated, negotiated, and executed the amended agreements with health care providers under selective contracting are not subject to the laws and regulations governing acquisition of goods and services by state agencies. (2) Health care providers shall be required to apply for selective provider agreements on an individual basis. Proposals by combinations of health care providers under common ownership in a market area shall be considered as individual proposals if the health care providers elect to apply on that basis. Proposals by combinations of health care providers in a market area that are not under common ownership will also be considered, provided that each health care provider that is a party to a joint application in a market area also submits an independent application for a selective contracting agreement in that market area; and each such health care provider provides written assurances that the terms of its individual proposal were arrived at independently without consultation with any other health care provider or combination of health care providers, and have not been communicated to any competitor or group of competitors. The department does not intend any action by the State of Texas in the contracting process to require or sanction any form of communication or joint action by competitors in the market for inpatient hospital services (with respect to either individual or joint applications) that fails to comply with the provisions of this section. (3) The department shall send solicitation packages, inviting proposals for selective provider agreements, to each health care provider serving residents of the counties selected for participation. Health care providers will be required at all times to be eligible to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Health care providers that are not sent solicitation packages for Medicaid recipients of a particular market will be able to request a package after demonstrating their intent to offer services to Medicaid recipients in those markets. (d) Proposals for selective provider agreements. Health care providers seeking selective provider agreements shall be required to submit the following information in their proposals: (1) a schedule of proposed payment rates to be applied to all covered health care provider inpatient services during the term of the agreement; (2) a proposed level of volume of services to Medicaid recipients that the health care provider would agree to serve during the contract period (this proposed level shall serve only as an estimate of services to assist the department in evaluating the availability of services within the relevant market area; it shall not serve as a limit on the amount of reimbursable services to be supplied by a contracting hospital); (3) data to assist the department in evaluating the effective service area and specialized service offerings of the health care provider; (4) assurances and certifications required to ensure health care provider compliance with the requirements of federal and Texas law and regulations, and the requirements of the department's selective contracting process; (5) a narrative description of the proposed plans (if any) of the acute care hospital to furnish optional volume management programs for Medicaid recipients; and (6) evidence that the application of the health care provider constitutes a binding quotation authorized by the corporate governance of the health care provider. (e) Evaluation of proposals for selective provider agreements for comprehensive market area selective contracting. The department shall evaluate health care provider proposals, except proposals from new facilities according to the following criteria. (1) Health care provider proposals shall be due to the department within one month of the release of proposal packages. All health care provider materials submitted to the department during the proposal process, and materials developed by the department or its contractors during the course of evaluation and negotiation, shall be confidential until all agreements are executed for all market areas in the state. (2) The department shall evaluate health care provider proposals on a market-by-market basis and determine a negotiation strategy to pursue in each market area following its evaluation of all market areas. Based on the application of pre-specified evaluation criteria for each market area, the department shall prepare a recommended strategy for contracting in each market area. Each market area strategy shall be subject to approval by the Executive Oversight Committee established by the department. (3) The department shall retain the option to make awards without negotiation. In some circumstances, the department may accept the proposals offered by every health care provider in the market area. In most cases, however, the department expects to enter into negotiations with those health care providers whose proposals, taken together, appear to represent the best combination of providers consistent with the overall objectives of the Medical Assistance Program. After negotiation, the department reserves the right not to award an agreement in a specific market area. In most cases, however, the department shall proceed to finalize and execute agreements with some subset of the health care providers in each market area. In that event, coverage restrictions associated with the use of non-contracted health care providers Medicaid recipients shall apply. Cont'd..."

Payments are made to private and governmental  providers of ground and air ambulance services as specified in the  ambulance program rules in Chapter 354, Subchapter A, Division 9 of  this title (relating to Ambulance Services). The reimbursement determination  authority is specified in §355.101 of this chapter (relating  to Introduction). (b) Definitions. The following words and terms, when  used in this section, have the following meanings unless the context  clearly indicates otherwise. (1) Allowable costs--Expenses that are reasonable and  necessary for the normal conduct of operations relating to the provision  of ground and air ambulance services.  (2) Average Commercial Rate--The average amount payable  by commercial payers for the same service. (3) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)--The  federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human  Services responsible for overseeing and directing Medicare and Medicaid,  or its successor. (4) Governmental ambulance provider--An ambulance provider  that uses paid government employees to provide ambulance services.  The ambulance services must be directly funded by a unit of government  that has taxing authority or has direct access to tax revenues, such  as a local government, hospital authority, hospital district, city,  county, or state. A private ambulance provider under contract with  a governmental entity to provide ambulance services is not considered  a governmental ambulance provider for the purposes of this section. (5) Medicaid shortfall--The unreimbursed cost to an  ambulance provider of providing Medicaid ambulance services to Medicaid  clients. (6) Private ambulance provider--An ambulance provider  that uses paid employees associated and financed through a private  entity to provide ambulance services and may be under contract with  a local, state, or federal government. (7) Uncompensated care costs--The sum of the Medicaid  shortfall and the uninsured costs.  (8) Uninsured costs--The unreimbursed cost to an ambulance  provider of providing ambulance services that meet the definition  of ""medical assistance"" in Social Security Act §1905(a) to uninsured  patients as defined by CMS. (9) Unit of service--A unit of service based on one  or more allowable ambulance services provided to a client by all modes  of approved transportation. (c) Reimbursement methodologies. (1) Fee-for-service ambulance fee. Fee-for-service  reimbursement is based on the lesser of a provider's billed charges  or the maximum fee established by the Texas Health and Human Services  Commission (HHSC). HHSC establishes fees by reviewing the Medicare  fee schedule and analyzing any other available ambulance-related data.  Fee-for-service rates apply to both private and governmental ambulance  providers. (2) Supplemental payment and enhanced supplemental  payment for governmental ambulance providers. For services provided  through September 30, 2019, a governmental ambulance provider may  be eligible to receive a supplemental payment in addition to the fee-for-service  payment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. For services  provided beginning October 1, 2019, eligibility for governmental ambulance  providers to receive a supplemental payment, and the methodology for  calculating the payment amount, are described in §355.8210 of  this subchapter (relating to Waiver Payments to Governmental Ambulance  Providers for Uncompensated Charity Care). (A) Eligibility for supplemental payments. A governmental  ambulance provider must submit a written request for determination  of eligibility for supplemental payment in a manner designated by  HHSC. If eligible, a governmental ambulance provider may begin to  claim uncompensated care costs related to services provided on or  after the first day of the month after the request for determination  of eligibility is approved. HHSC only considers requests for determination  of eligibility from governmental ambulance providers as defined in  subsection (b) of this section. HHSC will respond to all written requests  for consideration, indicating the requestor's eligibility to receive  supplemental payments. An acceptable request must include: (i) an overview of the governmental agency; (ii) a complete organizational chart of the governmental  agency; (iii) a complete organizational chart of the ambulance  department within the governmental agency providing ambulance services; (iv) an identification of the specific geographic service  area covered by the ambulance department, by ZIP code; (v) copies of all job descriptions for staff types  or job categories of staff who work for the ambulance department and  an estimated percentage of time spent working for the ambulance department  and other departments of the governmental agency; (vi) a primary contact person for the governmental  agency who can respond to questions about the ambulance department;  and  (vii) a signed letter documenting the governmental  ambulance provider's voluntary contribution of non-federal funds. (B) Eligibility for enhanced supplemental payments.  A governmental ambulance provider must submit an application for enhanced  supplemental payments to HHSC using a form designated by HHSC that  includes the cost and payment data for paid Medicaid and commercial  claims for all procedure codes specified in the application. If HHSC  approves the application, a governmental ambulance provider may begin  to claim enhanced supplemental payments based on the average commercial  rate related only to ground ambulance services reimbursed by Texas  Medicaid on a fee-for-service basis provided on or after the first  day of the month after the application is approved. HHSC will respond  to all applications, indicating approval or disapproval of the applicant's  eligibility to receive enhanced supplemental payments. An acceptable  application must include:  (i) proof of enrollment as a Medicaid provider in the  State of Texas at the beginning of the current demonstration year  as defined in §355.8210 of this subchapter;  (ii) a primary contact person for the government agency  who can respond to questions about the ambulance department;  (iii) a statement from the provider expressing its  intent to participate in the program; and  (iv) a cost report that includes the cost and payment  data for paid Medicaid and commercial claims for all procedure codes  specified by HHSC.  (C) Cost reports. Governmental ambulance providers  that are eligible for supplemental or enhanced supplemental payments  must submit an annual cost report for ground and air ambulance services  delivered to Medicaid and, effective March 1, 2012, uninsured clients  on a cost report form specified by HHSC. Providers certify through  the cost report process their total actual federal and non-federal  costs and expenditures for the cost reporting period. Cost reports  must be completed for a full year based on the federal fiscal year.  HHSC may require newly eligible providers to submit a partial-year  cost report for their first year of eligibility. The beginning date  for the partial-year cost report is the provider's first day of eligibility  for supplemental or enhanced supplemental payments as determined by  HHSC. The ending date of the partial-year cost report is the last  day of the federal fiscal year that encompasses the cost report beginning  date. (i) Due date. The cost report is due on or before March  31 of the year following the cost reporting period ending date, September  30, and must be certified in a manner specified by HHSC. If March  31 falls on a federal or state holiday or weekend, the due date is  the first business day after March 31. A provider may request in writing,  by regular mail or special mail delivery, an extension of up to 30  days after the due date to submit a cost report. HHSC will respond  to all written requests for extensions, indicating whether the extension  is granted. HHSC must receive a request for extension before the cost  report due date. A request for extension received after the due date  is considered denied. A provider whose cost report is not received  by the due date or the extended due date is ineligible for supplemental  or enhanced supplemental payments for the federal fiscal year. (ii) Purpose. A cost report documents the provider's  actual allowable Medicaid and uncompensated care costs for delivering  ambulance services in accordance with the applicable state and federal  regulations. Because the cost report is used to determine supplemental  and enhanced supplemental payments, a provider must submit a complete  and acceptable cost report to be eligible for a supplemental or enhanced  supplemental payment. (iii) Allocating allowable costs. A provider's total  allowable reported costs for ambulance services are allocated to Medicaid  and uninsured patients based on the ratio of charges for Medicaid  and uninsured patients to the charges for all patients. Only allocable  expenditures related to Medicaid, Medicaid managed care, and uncompensated  care as defined and approved in the Texas Healthcare Transformation  and Quality Improvement 1115 Waiver Program (1115 Waiver) will be  included for supplemental payment. (D) Calculation of supplemental payments and enhanced  supplemental payments. (i) For services provided from October 1, 2011, through  February 29, 2012, a governmental ambulance provider may be eligible  to receive a supplemental payment equal to its Medicaid shortfall  for the cost reporting period multiplied by the federal Medical assistance  percentage (FMAP) in effect during the cost reporting period. (ii) For services provided on or after March 1, 2012,  and subject to approval by CMS, a governmental ambulance provider  may be eligible to receive a supplemental payment equal to its uncompensated  care costs for the cost reporting period multiplied by the FMAP in  effect during the cost reporting period. (iii) Supplemental payments based on uncompensated  care costs are limited by the maximum aggregate amount of the estimated  uncompensated care costs for all eligible governmental ambulance providers  as determined by §355.8201 of this chapter (relating to Waiver  Payments to Hospitals for Uncompensated Care). (iv) If the actual aggregate uncompensated care costs  for all eligible governmental ambulance providers is greater than  the maximum aggregate amount of the estimated uncompensated care costs  for all eligible governmental ambulance providers as described in  clause (iii) of this subparagraph, then HHSC will reduce the supplemental  payments for all participating governmental ambulance providers proportionately. (v) The supplemental payment is contingent upon the  governmental ambulance provider's certificate of public expenditures  submitted with each cost report. (vi) If the federal government disallows federal financial  participation related to the receipt or use of supplemental payments  under this section, HHSC will recoup an amount equal to the federal  share of supplemental payments overpaid or disallowed.  (E) Enhanced supplemental payment.  (i) For ground services reimbursed on a fee-for-service  basis provided on or after October 1, 2019, a governmental ambulance  provider may be eligible to receive an enhanced supplemental payment  equal to the difference between the average commercial rate and the  sum of its reimbursed costs for the cost reporting period.  (I) HHSC will determine the paid Medicaid claims fees  and enhanced supplemental payment amounts for all procedure codes  specified in the application for each eligible publicly owned fee-for-service  ground emergency ambulance service provider.  (II) HHSC will calculate an overall average commercial  rate for the ambulance service providers based on the cost and payment  data provided from each eligible ambulance provider.  (III) HHSC will apply the overall average commercial  rate to an ambulance provider's total Medicaid utilization to determine  the ambulance provider's total commercial reimbursement.  (IV) HHSC will subtract the ambulance provider's total  Medicaid reimbursement from the ambulance provider's total commercial  reimbursement calculated for each of the eligible services.  (V) HHSC will calculate each ambulance provider's maximum  payment limit by summing each of the differences calculated in subclause  (IV) of this clause for each of the provider's eligible services.  (VI) HHSC will re-determine the average commercial  rate at least annually.  (VII) The enhanced supplemental payment is contingent  upon the governmental ambulance provider's data submitted with each  cost report. HHSC will determine payment amounts on a quarterly basis,  with a reimbursement of up to 100 percent for each ambulance provider's  average commercial rate.  (ii) If CMS disallows federal financial participation  related to a provider's receipt or use of enhanced supplemental payments  under this section, HHSC will recoup from the provider an amount equal  to the disallowance. If HHSC identifies an overpayment to a provider  related to the receipt or use of enhanced supplemental payments under  this section, HHSC will recoup from the provider an amount equal to  the overpayment.

(b) The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) uses the definitions under the provisions of §1917(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396p(h)). (1) Assets include all income and resources of a person and of the person's spouse, including any income or resources that the person or the person's spouse is entitled to but does not receive because of action: (A) by the person or the person's spouse; (B) by an individual, including a court or administrative body, with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the person or the person's spouse; or (C) by any individual, including any court or administrative body, acting at the direction or upon the request of the person or the person's spouse. (2) The term ""income"" has the meaning given such term in §1612 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1382a). (3) The term ""resources"" has the meaning given such term in §1613 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1382b), without regard (in the case of a person in an institutional setting) to the exclusion of the home. (c) In this section, ""person"" includes the applicant or recipient as well as: (1) the person's spouse; (2) an individual, including a court or administrative body, with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the person or person's spouse; and (3) any individual, including a court or administrative body, acting at the direction or upon the request of the person or the person's spouse. (d) HHSC applies the penalty for transfers of assets under the provisions of §1917(c)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396p(c)(1)). The provisions of §358.402 of this division (relating to Transfer of Assets before February 8, 2006) continue in effect for transfers on or after February 8, 2006, except to the extent that they are inconsistent with this section. (1) This paragraph establishes HHSC's treatment of transfers made on or after February 8, 2006, the date of enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. (A) Disposing of assets. If a person in an institutional setting or the spouse of such a person disposes of assets for less than fair market value on or after the look-back date specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the person is ineligible for medical assistance for services described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph during the period beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and equal to the number of months specified in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. (B) Look-back period. (i) The look-back date specified in this subparagraph is a date that is 36 months (or, in the case of payments involving a trust or portions of a trust that are treated as assets disposed of by the person pursuant to §358.402(e)(2) of this division or in the case of any other disposal of assets made on or after February 8, 2006, the date of enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, 60 months) before the date specified in clause (ii) of this subparagraph. (ii) The date specified in this clause, with respect to: (I) a person in an institutional setting, except a person receiving services under a §1915(c) waiver program, is the first date as of which the person both is in an institutional setting and has applied for medical assistance under the Texas State Plan for Medical Assistance; or (II) a person receiving services under a §1915(c) waiver program, is the date on which the person applies for medical assistance under the Texas State Plan for Medical Assistance or, if later, the date on which the person disposes of assets for less than fair market value. (C) Ineligible for medical assistance for services. A person in an institutional setting who disposes of assets as described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is ineligible for the following services: (i) nursing facility services; (ii) a level of care in any institution equivalent to that of nursing facility services; and (iii) §1915(c) waiver program services. (D) Beginning date of penalty. (i) In the case of a transfer of asset made before February 8, 2006, the date of enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the beginning date of penalty, specified in this subparagraph, is the first day of the first month during or after which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value and which does not occur in any other periods of ineligibility under this subsection. (ii) In the case of a transfer of asset made on or after February 8, 2006, the date of enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the beginning date of penalty, specified in this subparagraph, is the first day of a month during or after which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value, or the date on which the person is eligible for medical assistance under the Texas State Plan for Medical Assistance and would otherwise be receiving institutional level of care described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph based on an approved application for such care but for the application of the penalty period, whichever is later, and which does not occur during any other period of ineligibility under this subsection. (E) Length of ineligibility period. (i) With respect to a person in an institutional setting, except a person receiving services under a §1915(c) waiver program, the number of months of ineligibility under this subparagraph for such person is equal to the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the person (or person's spouse) on or after the look-back date specified in subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph, divided by the average monthly cost to a private patient of nursing facility services in the state at the time of application. (ii) With respect to a person receiving services under a §1915(c) waiver program, the number of months of ineligibility under this subparagraph for such person must not be greater than a number equal to the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the person (or person's spouse) on or after the look-back date specified in subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph, divided by the average monthly cost to a private patient of nursing facility services in the state at the time of application. (iii) The number of months of ineligibility otherwise determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph with respect to the disposal of an asset shall be reduced: (I) in the case of periods of ineligibility determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph, by the number of months of ineligibility applicable to the person under clause (ii) of this subparagraph has a result of such disposal; and (II) in the case of periods of ineligibility determined under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, by the number of months of ineligibility applicable to the person under clause (i) of this subparagraph as a result of such disposal. (iv) HHSC does not round down, or otherwise disregard any fractional period of ineligibility determined under clause (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph with respect to the disposal of assets. (F) Annuity. The purchase of an annuity made on or after February 8, 2006, the date of enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, is treated as the disposal of an asset for less than fair market value unless: (i) the State is named as the remainder beneficiary in the first position for at least the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the annuitant under this title; or (ii) the State is named as such a beneficiary in the second position after the community spouse or minor or disabled child and is named in the first position if such spouse or a representative of such child disposes of any such remainder for less than fair market value. (G) Annuity exceptions. With respect to a transfer of assets, the term ""assets"" includes an annuity purchased on or after February 8, 2006, the date of enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, by or on behalf of an annuitant who has applied for medical assistance with respect to services in an institutional setting unless: (i) the annuity is: (I) an annuity described in subsection (b) or (q) of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or (II) purchased with proceeds from: (-a-) an account or trust described in subsection (a), (c), or (p) of section 408 of such Code; (-b-) a simplified employee pension (within the meaning of section 408(k) of such Code); or (-c-) a Roth IRA described in section 408A of such Code; or (ii) the annuity: (I) is irrevocable and nonassignable; (II) is actuarially sound (as determined in accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services); and (III) provides for payments in equal amounts during the term of the annuity, with no deferral and no balloon payments made. (H) Promissory note, loan, or mortgage. In the case of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage that does not satisfy the requirements of clauses (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph, the value of such note, loan, or mortgage is the outstanding balance due as of the date of the person's application for medical assistance for services described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and this amount would be used to determine the length of ineligibility. For purposes of this paragraph with respect to a transfer of assets, the term ""assets"" includes funds used to purchase, on or after April 1, 2006, a promissory note, loan, or mortgage unless such note, loan, or mortgage: (i) has a repayment term that is actuarially sound (as determined in accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration); (ii) provides for payments to be made in equal amounts during the term of the loan, with no deferral and no balloon payments made; and (iii) prohibits the cancellation of the balance upon the death of the lender. (I) Life estate. For purposes of this paragraph with respect to a transfer of assets, the term ""assets"" includes the purchase of a life estate interest in another individual's home made on or after April 1, 2006, unless the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least one year after the date of the purchase. (2) HHSC allows exceptions to transfers of assets under the provisions of §1917(c)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396p(c)(2), if: (A) the assets transferred were a home, and title to the home was transferred to: (i) the spouse of such person; (ii) a child of such person who: (I) is under 21 years of age; or (II) is blind or disabled as defined in §1614 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1382c); (iii) a sibling of such person who has an equity interest in such home and who was residing in such person's home for at least one year immediately before the date the person transferred to an institutional setting; or (iv) a son or daughter of such person (other than a child described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph) who was residing in such person's home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the person transferred to an institutional setting and who, as determined by the State, provided care to such person which permitted such person to reside at home rather than in such an institution or facility; (B) the assets: (i) were transferred to the person's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the person's spouse; (ii) were transferred from the person's spouse to another for the sole benefit of the person's spouse; (iii) were transferred to a trust (including a trust described in §358.402(e)(2) of this division) established solely for the benefit of the person's child described in subparagraph (A)(ii)(II) of this paragraph; or (iv) were transferred to a trust (including a trust described in §358.402(e)(2) of this division) established solely for the benefit of a person under 65 years of age who is disabled as defined in §1614(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1382c(a)(3)); (C) a satisfactory showing is made to the State that: (i) the person intended to dispose of the assets either at fair market value, or for other valuable consideration; (ii) the assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medical assistance; or (iii) all assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the person; or (D) HHSC: (i) determines that the denial of eligibility would work an undue hardship when application of the transfer of assets provision would deprive the person: (I) of medical care such that the person's health or life would be endangered; or (II) of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities of life; and (ii) provides for: Cont'd..."

(1) The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) (P.L. 103-66) revised policy for transfers of assets that occur on or after August 11, 1993, when an uncompensated value remains. (2) The penalty for transfers of assets affects payments for institutional facility services (nursing facility (NF) care, intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation or related conditions (ICF/MR) provider services, care in state supported living centers and state centers, and care in institutions for mental diseases (IMD)) and eligibility for §1915(c) waiver program services. Both the recipient and the service provider are notified of the penalty period. (3) Except for residents of state supported living centers and state centers, persons in an institutional setting remain eligible for all other Medicaid benefits and continue to receive monthly identification forms for the length of the penalty period. For residents of state supported living centers and state centers, Medicaid eligibility is denied for any penalty period resulting from an uncompensated transfer of assets. This is because the only Medicaid benefit a resident of a state supported living center or state center receives is provider payments. (4) If the Medicaid eligibility of a person receiving services under a §1915(c) waiver program requires receipt of waiver services, then the person is ineligible for all Medicaid benefits for the length of the penalty period. Denial of §1915(c) waiver program services based on an uncompensated transfer of assets does not disqualify the person for pure Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) or Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) benefits, as described in Chapter 359 of this title (relating to Medicare Savings Program). (5) A person in a noninstitutional setting who is eligible for Medicaid may transfer assets without penalty, provided the person does not become institutionalized or apply for §1915(c) waiver program services. A transfer of assets does not affect eligibility for QMB or SLMB benefits. (6) In spousal situations, if assets are transferred to a third party before institutionalization or by the community spouse, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) does not include the uncompensated amount of the transfer in calculating the spousal protected resource amount or countable resources upon application for Medicaid. (b) Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. (1) Person--""Person"" includes the applicant or recipient, as well as: (A) the person's spouse; (B) an individual, including a court or administrative body, with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the person or person's spouse; and (C) any individual, including a court or administrative body, acting at the direction or upon the request of the person or the person's spouse. (2) Assets-- (A) Assets include all income and resources of a person and of the person's spouse, including any income or resources that the person or the person's spouse is entitled to but does not receive because of action: (i) by the person or the person's spouse; (ii) by an individual, including a court or administrative body, with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the person or the person's spouse; or (iii) by any individual, including a court or administrative body, acting at the direction or upon the request of the person or the person's spouse. (B) Actions that would cause income or resources not to be received include: (i) irrevocably waiving pension income; (ii) waiving the right to receive an inheritance; (iii) not accepting or accessing injury settlements; and (iv) a defendant diverting tort settlements into a trust or similar device to be held for the benefit of the plaintiff. (c) Transfer of income. (1) A person may incur a transfer penalty by transferring income on or after August 11, 1993. Transfers of income include: (A) waiving the right to receive an inheritance even in the month of receipt; (B) giving away a lump sum payment even in the month of receipt; or (C) irrevocably waiving all or part of federal, state, or private pensions or annuities. (2) The date of transfer is the date of the actual change in income, if on or after August 11, 1993. Interspousal transfers of income are permitted (for example, obtaining a court order to have community property pension income paid to a community spouse). (3) Because revocable waivers of pension benefits can be revoked and the benefits reinstated, no uncompensated value is developed, and no transfer-of-assets penalty is incurred. Such waivers are subject to the utilization-of-benefits policy, and the person must apply for reinstatement of the full pension amount or the person is ineligible for all Medicaid benefits. (d) Exceptions to transfers of assets. (1) Transfer of the person's home does not result in a penalty when the title is transferred to the person's: (A) spouse, who lives in the home (the transfer penalty applies when the community spouse transfers the home without full compensation); (B) minor or disabled child (a disabled child must meet Social Security Administration disability criteria; there is no age limit for a disabled child for transfer of assets purposes); (C) sibling who has equity interest in the home and has lived there for at least one year before the person transferred to an institutional setting; or (D) son or daughter (other than a disabled or minor child) who lived in the home for at least two years before the person transferred to an institutional setting and provided care that prevented institutionalization. To substantiate this claim, there must be a written statement from the person's attending physician or a professional social worker familiar with the case documenting the care provided by the son or daughter. (2) Assets, including the person's home, may be transferred without resulting in a penalty when: (A) transferred to the person's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of that spouse, or from the person's spouse to another for the sole benefit of that spouse; (B) transferred to the person's child or to a trust, including an exception trust described in §1917(d)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396p(d)(4)), established solely for the benefit of the person's child. The child must meet Social Security Administration disability criteria. There is no age limit for a disabled child for transfer of assets purposes; (C) transferred to a trust, including an exception trust as specified in §1917(d)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396p(d)(4)), established for the sole benefit of a person under 65 years of age who meets Social Security Administration disability criteria; (D) satisfactory evidence exists that the person intended to dispose of the resource at fair market value; (E) satisfactory evidence exists that the transfer was exclusively for some purpose other than to qualify for Medicaid; (F) imposition of a penalty would cause undue hardship; (G) a person changes a joint bank account to establish separate accounts to reflect correct ownership of and access to funds; or (H) a person purchases an irrevocable funeral arrangement or assigns ownership of an irrevocable funeral arrangement to a third party. (3) In determining whether an asset was transferred for the sole benefit of a spouse, child, or person with a disability, there must be a written instrument of transfer, such as a trust document, which legally binds the parties to a specified course of action and which clearly sets out the conditions under which the transfer was made, as well as who can benefit from the transfer. The instrument or document must provide for the spending of the funds involved for the benefit of the person on a basis that is actuarially sound based on the life expectancy of the person involved. When the instrument or document does not so provide, there can be no exemption from the penalty. Exception trusts created under §1917(d)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396p(d)(4)) are exempt from the actuarially sound distribution provisions of this section. (4) The situations in paragraphs (1) - (3) of this subsection are the only situations in which an uncompensated transfer does not result in a penalty for care in an institutional setting. Under the transfer provisions of OBRA 1993, the home is not an excluded resource for a person in an institutional setting. Therefore, if the home of a person in an institutional setting is transferred, unless the transfer meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (1) - (3) of this subsection, it could affect payment for the person's care in an institutional setting. (e) Look-back period. (1) Penalties may be assessed for transfers occurring on or after the look-back date. Penalties cannot be assessed for time frames prior to the look-back period. (2) The law prescribes a 36-month look-back period for most uncompensated transfers. However, there is a 60-month look-back period for certain transfers involving trusts. The look-back periods for trusts and distributions from trusts are defined in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph. (A) Revocable trusts. (i) Payments from a revocable trust to or for the benefit of someone other than an applicant or recipient have a 60-month look-back period. (ii) Making a revocable trust irrevocable with payments from corpus/income foreclosed to the applicant or recipient is a transfer of assets and has a 60-month look-back period. (B) Irrevocable trusts. (i) Payments from an irrevocable trust (where trustee distributions are not foreclosed to the applicant or recipient) which are made to (or for the benefit of) someone other than the applicant or recipient have a 36-month look-back period. (ii) Creating an irrevocable trust where trustee payments are foreclosed to the applicant or recipient is a transfer of assets with a 60-month look-back period. (iii) Creating an irrevocable trust where the trustee initially has discretion to make payments to the applicant or recipient (or for the applicant's or recipient's benefit), but where payments are foreclosed to the applicant or recipient at a later date is a transfer of assets as of the date payments are foreclosed to the applicant or recipient. The look-back period is 60 months. (3) The look-back period is 36 months (or 60 months) from the later of the date of: (A) institutionalization; or (B) Medicaid application. (4) When a person is already a Medicaid recipient before entering an NF, an ICF/MR, a state supported living center, a state center, or an IMD, the look-back period begins with institutional entry. (5) When a person applies and is certified for Medicaid more than once because of multiple institutional stays or periods of ineligibility, the look-back date is based on the later of the earliest application for Medicaid or the initial entry into the facility. (6) When a person applies for a §1915(c) waiver program, the look-back period is 36 months or 60 months from the later of the date: (A) of application for waiver services (completed, signed application form is received in HHSC office); or (B) after application that the person transfers assets. (7) When a person applies for services in an institutional setting but is not certified and then reapplies, a new look-back period is based on the latest application. (8) When a person applies and is certified for a §1915(c) waiver program, subsequently is denied, and reapplies for waiver services, the initial look-back period is still in effect. (9) When a look-back period is established, the person is certified, and then moves from a Medicaid-certified long-term care facility to a §1915(c) waiver program or vice versa, the initial look-back period is still in effect. This is true even when there is a gap in eligibility periods. (10) Any additional transfers of assets that occur after the person is certified for Medicaid may be assessed a penalty. (f) Calculation of penalty period. (1) There is no limit to the penalty period under OBRA 1993. The penalty period is determined by dividing the uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the average monthly cost of nursing facility care for a private-pay patient. (2) The penalty period calculation applies to the transfer of both income and resources. (3) The same penalty period calculation is used for a person who applies for a §1915(c) waiver program. Penalty periods continue to run if a person moves from a Medicaid-certified long-term care facility to a §1915(c) waiver program or vice versa. (4) The penalty period begins the month of transfer. However, a new penalty period cannot be imposed while a previous penalty period is still in effect. Therefore, the penalty periods assessed under OBRA 1993 rules for multiple transfers that overlap run separately but consecutively. Cont'd..."

If the review of additional records is necessary then conduct such  review. (3) A description of the MCO's procedures for detecting  possible acts of waste, abuse, and fraud by recipients. The description  must address the following: (A) Review of claims when waste, abuse, or fraud is  suspected or reported to determine if: (i) Treatment(s) and/or medication(s) prescribed by  more than one provider appears to be duplicative, excessive, or contraindicated; (ii) Recipients are using more than one provider to  obtain similar treatments and /or medications; (iii) Providers other than the assigned Primary Care  Provider (PCP) are treating the recipient, and there is no evidence  that the recipient was treated by the assigned PCP for a similar or  related condition; and (iv) The recipient has a high volume of emergency room  visits with a non-emergent diagnosis. (B) Review medical or dental records for the recipients  in question if claims review does not clearly determine if waste,  abuse, or fraud has occurred. (C) For health care MCOs, use of edits or other evaluation  techniques to identify possible overuse or abuse of psychotropic or  controlled medications by recipients who are allegedly treated at  least monthly by two or more physicians. A physician includes: psychiatrists,  pain management specialists, anesthesiologists, and physical medicine  and rehabilitation specialists.

The nursing facility must conduct  the assessment using a Minimum Data Set (MDS) Resident Assessment  Instrument (RAI) based on the MDS RAI Resource Utilization Group (RUG-III)  34-group case mix classification system selected by the state and  established by CMS. (1) Requirements for completing the MDS are derived  from the RAI, including the MDS, specified by the DADS. The nursing  facility must adhere to any updates released by CMS in addition to  the state-specific mandates. To the extent such CMS updates conflict  with DADS-specific mandates, the CMS updates control. (2) Completion of the MDS does not remove the nursing  facility's responsibility to document in a clinical record a detailed  assessment of all relevant issues that affect the recipient. All clinical  record documentation must chronicle, support, and be consistent with  the findings of, rather than conflict with, each MDS assessment. Documentation  in the clinical record must contain pertinent facts, findings, and  observations about an individual's health history including past and  present illnesses, treatments, and outcomes to support the care the  recipients are receiving. Inconsistent and unsupported findings are  not validated and may result in an adjustment in the RUG-III classification. (3) All coded items on MDS assessments submitted for  Medicaid reimbursement must be supported by documentation in the recipient's  clinical record. Sources of information (e.g., other health care professionals,  family members) utilized for the MDS assessment must be identified  and must be supported by the clinical record. (4) Nursing facility resident records must be maintained  in accordance with: (A) 40 TAC §19.1910 (relating to Clinical Records); (B) 40 TAC §19.1912 (relating to Additional Clinical  Record Service Requirements); (C) 40 TAC §19.1210 (relating to Certification  and Recertification Requirements in Medicaid-Certified Facilities); (D) 40 TAC §19.1924 (relating to Financial Records),  including supporting documents and other records necessary to fully  document the services and supplies provided and delivered to the resident,  the medical necessity of those services and supplies, and records  or documents necessary to determine whether payment for those items  or services was due and was properly made; (E) Section 354.1004 of this title (relating to Retention  of Records), which requires a facility to maintain all records necessary  to fully disclose the services provided and to retain these records  for a period of five years from the date of the service, or until  all audit questions are resolved, whichever is longer; (F) HIPAA; (G) 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164 (relating to Health  Insurance Reform: Security Standards); and (H) accepted professional health information management  standards and practices. (5) Documentation must have the recipient's name and  the signatures, dates of signatures, and titles of individuals providing  care for the recipient. Documents, such as grids and flow sheets that  include entries by multiple staff members at different times, must  include complete dates with initials or signatures to clearly identify  who provided the care. For purposes of this subchapter, a signature  may be an original handwritten, electronic, photocopied, or facsimile-transmitted  signature or an electronic signature submitted in compliance with  HHSC policy unless the authenticity of the signature is in doubt. (b) An admission comprehensive assessment must be completed  by day 14 and include the Basic Assessment Tracking form and MDS Sections  AA, AB-AD, A-R, Sections V and W. The annual assessment must be completed  no later than the 366th day from the last comprehensive assessment  and no later than 92 days from the previous assessment. (1) The MDS Long-Term Care Medicaid Information Section  and Section W must be completed on all MDS assessments submitted for  Medicaid. (2) An admission assessment or quarterly assessment  establishes RUG-III classification. Medical necessity is evaluated  each time an MDS assessment is completed, until permanent medical  necessity is established by the Texas Medicaid claims administrator  (MCA), as set out in 40 TAC §19.2403 (relating to Medical Necessity  Determination). (3) A significant-change assessment must be completed  as soon as needed to provide appropriate care to the resident, but  in no case later than 14 calendar days after the determination was  made that a significant change occurred. The nursing facility must  document the significant change in condition. The documentation must  include a completed comprehensive MDS assessment with Resident Assessment  Protocols. A significant change assessment resets the schedule for  the next annual assessment. (4) A quarterly assessment following an admission assessment,  an annual assessment, or a significant change-in-status assessment  must be completed within 92 days of the previous assessment. (5) An MDS assessment is considered complete on the  date the registered nurse (RN) assessment coordinator signs and dates  the MDS assessment as complete. That date may not be prior to dates  for all sections completed. (6) The MDS assessment is considered timely if it is  submitted in accordance with the federal MDS submission schedule and  is received by the state MCA within 31 days after the completion date. (7) Each MDS assessment submitted must indicate the  reason for the assessment. (8) Assessment time frames are based on the assessment  reference date, which is the specific end-point for a common observation  period (look back period) in the MDS assessment process. (c) All MDS items shall be coded in accordance with  42 C.F.R. §483.20 (relating to Resident Assessment); the CMS  Long-Term Care Facility Resident Assessment Instrument User's Manual  (RAI User's Manual); and state-specific requirements. Coding for items  described in this subsection must be based on observations over the  look back period specified. If the observation did not occur during  the look back period, it is not coded on the MDS. (1) Cognitive Patterns. The look back period for items  described in this paragraph is seven days. (A) Comatose Code One is claimed only when the recipient's  clinical record includes a documented neurological diagnosis of coma  or persistent vegetative state. The clinical record must include physician  documentation of a diagnosis of coma or persistent vegetative state. (B) Short-Term Memory Code One is claimed when it is  determined that the recipient lacks the functional capacity to recall  recent events. Documentation in the clinical record must support the  resident's capacity to remember short-term events. (C) For Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision Making,  code the correct response between zero and three that supports the  recipient's level of ability based on the clinical record. The recipient's  clinical record must include documentation describing the recipient's  actual performance in making everyday decisions about tasks or activities  of daily living. (2) Communication/Hearing Patterns. For Making Self  Understood, code the correct response between zero and three that  supports the recipient's level of ability to make himself or herself  understood. The recipient's clinical record must support the resident's  level of ability to express or communicate requests, needs, opinions,  urgent problems, and social conversation, whether in speech, writing,  sign language, or a combination of these. The look back period is  seven days. (3) Mood and Behavior Patterns. (A) For Indicators of Depression, Anxiety and Sad mood,  code between zero and two based on documented interactions and observations  of the recipient. The recipient's clinical record must support the  frequency of the indicators of depression, anxiety, and/or sad mood.  The look back period is 30 days. (B) For Behavioral Symptoms, code between zero and  three the frequency of behavioral symptoms manifested by the resident  across all three shifts as it occurred during the look back period.  The look back period is seven days. Record the frequency of behavioral  symptoms manifested by the resident across all three shifts. (4) Physical Functioning and Structural Problems. The  look back period for items described in this paragraph is seven days. (A) For Self Performance, code between zero and four  or eight for self performance by the recipient in bed mobility, transfer,  eating, and toilet use during the look back period. The clinical record  must capture the total picture of the recipient's actual self care  performance for each activity of daily living (ADL) over the seven  day period, 24 hours a day. (B) For ADL Support Provided, code from zero and three  or eight to support assistance provided by staff in bed mobility,  transfer, and toilet use. The clinical record must reflect the support  provided by staff, for each ADL, over a 24-hour period, during the  look back period. (5) Continence Appliances and Programs. The look back  period for items described in this paragraph is 14 days. (A) For Scheduled Toileting Plan, check if recipient  is on any scheduled toileting program. The documentation must include  a plan for bowel and/or bladder elimination whereby staff members  at scheduled times each day either take the recipient to the toilet,  give the recipient a urinal, or remind the recipient to go to the  toilet. This includes bowel habit training and/or prompted voiding,  but does not include changing wet garments. A ""program"" refers to  a specific approach that is organized, planned, documented, monitored  and evaluated. The recipient's toileting schedule must be in a place  where it is clearly communicated, available to and easily accessible  to all staff. The care plan must indicate the recipient is on a routine  toileting schedule. (B) For Bladder Retraining Program, check if recipient  is on any bladder retraining program that is a retraining program  to teach the recipient to consciously delay urinating or to resist  the urge to urinate. The care plan must include individualized goals  and approaches that is organized, planned, documented, monitored,  and evaluated. (6) Disease Diagnosis. The disease conditions described  in this paragraph require a physician-documented diagnosis in the  clinical record. The look back period is seven days. (A) For Diseases, code diabetes, aphasia, cerebral  palsy, hemiplegia/hemiparesis, multiple sclerosis, and/or quadriplegia  if there is a documented physician diagnosis in the clinical record.  Include active diagnoses only; do not include conditions that have  been resolved or have not affected the recipient's functioning, medical  treatment, or care plan. (B) For Infections, code pneumonia and/or septicemia,  if the infection was present with a documented relationship to the  recipient's current functioning, medical treatment, or care plan.  A physician documented diagnosis in the clinical record is required  to code this item. (7) Health Conditions. The look back period for items  described in this paragraph is seven days. As applicable, review the  clinical records (including the current nursing care plan) and consult  with facility staff members and resident's family if the resident  is unable to respond. (A) For Problem Conditions, code documented problems  or symptoms that affect or could affect the recipient's health or  functional status and to identify risk factors for illness, accident,  and functional decline, as they occurred during the look back period. (B) For Dehydrated; Output Exceeds Intake Code only  if the recipient has at least two of the following indicators: (i) Receives less than 1500 ml fluids daily; (ii) One or more clinical signs or symptoms of dehydration;  or (iii) Fluid loss exceeds daily intake. (C) For Delusions, the recipient's clinical record  must support that the recipient holds fixed, false beliefs not shared  by others based on observation during the look back period. (D) For Fever, include documentation that the recorded  temperature of 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit or greater than the documented  established baseline for that recipient was observed during the look  back period. (E) For Hallucinations, the recipient's clinical record  must support the recipient's false sensory perceptions that occur  in the absence of any real stimuli as observed and documented during  the look back period. (F) For Internal bleeding, the clinical record must  support frank or occult bleeding in the clinical record based on observations  during the look back period, excluding simple nosebleeds that are  easily controlled.  (G) For Vomiting, the clinical record must support  that regurgitation of stomach contents occurred during the look back  period. Cont'd..."

The groups  represent the recipient's relative direct care resource requirements. (b) The Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score is based  on the recipient's care needs that are provided by the nursing facility  staff. The ADL score is used to determine a recipient's placement  in a RUG-III category and is based on the recipient's care needs provided  by the nursing facility staff. The score is incorporated into acuity  measurements established under the RUG-III recipient classification  methodology. The clinical record must support items claimed for Medicaid  reimbursement on the Minimum Data Set (MDS). (c) The state-specific Long-Term Care Medicaid Information  Section is a part of the MDS assessment Resident Assessment Instrument  (RAI) in Texas and must be completed for Medicaid reimbursement. The  Long-Term Care Medicaid Information Section must include the last  name and license number of the registered nurse (RN) assessment coordinator. (d) The Basic Tracking Form must include: (1) the signature and title of each licensed nurse  or health care professional completing any section of the MDS assessment  for Medicaid reimbursement; and (2) the section(s) and completion date(s) corresponding  to the signature of the nurse or health care professional. (e) Each individual signing the signature section on  the Basic Tracking Form is certifying that the information entered  on the MDS assessment is accurate. A facility that submits false or  inaccurate information is subject to sanctions under Subchapter G  of this chapter (relating to Administrative Actions and Sanctions). (f) If the nursing facility recipient is a hospice  recipient, the nursing facility must comply with the requirements  of 40 TAC §19.1926 (relating to Medicaid Hospice Services) and  maintain in the recipient's clinical record copies of the completed  Texas Medicaid Hospice Program Recipient Election/Cancellation/Discharge  Notice (Form 3071), and the DADS Medicaid/Medicare Hospice Program  Physician Certification of Terminal Illness (Form 3074). (1) The nursing facility must acknowledge a recipient's  admission to hospice services on the Special Treatments, Procedures,  and Programs section when completing an MDS full, comprehensive, or  quarterly assessment. (2) An MDS assessment indicating that a recipient has  elected hospice services is not processed until the Texas Medicaid  Hospice Program Recipient Election/Cancellation/Discharge Notice (Form  3071), and the DADS Medicaid/Medicare Hospice Program Physician Certification  of Terminal Illness (Form 3074) are received by the Texas Medicaid  Claims Administrator. (3) When a recipient is admitted to hospice and there  has not been a significant change in condition, a significant change  in status assessment does not have to be completed. The recipient's  next scheduled assessment may be used. (g) Each nurse's license number submitted on the MDS  assessment, Long-Term Care Medicaid Information Section, is validated  with the Texas Board of Nursing or as applicable as a nurse compact  license with the licensing state. An MDS assessment is rejected for  Medicaid reimbursement if an invalid or delinquent license number  is submitted on the MDS assessment, Long-Term Care Medicaid Information  Section. (h) Nursing facility staff must complete the HHSC-approved  MDS training in accordance with this subsection. (1) The nursing facility RN Assessment Coordinator  must complete the HHSC-approved online MDS training course prior to  completing an MDS assessment for Medicaid payment. All other staff  completing the MDS assessment for Medicaid payment are encouraged  to take the MDS Training prior to completing the MDS assessment. (2) The nursing facility RN Assessment Coordinator  must repeat the MDS online training every two years. A certificate  of completion is issued at the conclusion of the training. (3) If the nursing facility RN Assessment Coordinator  does not complete the MDS training every two years as required by  HHSC, the license number of the RN Assessment Coordinator is not accepted  into the state database and the MDS assessment is rejected by the  Medicaid claims administrator. (i) An admission assessment, a quarterly assessment,  significant change in status assessment, annual assessment, significant  correction to a prior quarterly assessment, or a significant correction  to a prior annual assessment establishes a RUG-III group. (1) A significant change in status assessment, which  requires a comprehensive MDS with Resident Assessment Protocols, must  be completed by the end of the 14th calendar day following determination  that a significant change has occurred. (2) A significant change in status assessment resets  the schedule for the next annual assessment. (j) Permanent medical necessity is determined by DADS  in accordance with 40 TAC §19.2403 (relating to Medical Necessity  Determination). (k) When correcting errors in an MDS assessment, the  nursing facility staff must use the MDS Correction Policy in Chapter  5 of the Minimum Data Set, Resident Assessment Instrument User's Manual,  published by CMS. (1) Documentation must be maintained in the clinical  record to support the corrected MDS assessment form and be available  for review by the OIG staff during MDS utilization reviews. (2) The Correction Request Form attestation of accuracy  of signatures must contain the RN assessment coordinator's and Director  of Nursing's signatures, and the date the correction was completed. (3) A correction to a RUG reclassification error identified  during an on-site review is considered an assessment error as described  in subsection (r)(2) of this section. This does not negate the facility's  responsibility to make quality of care corrections pursuant to the  CMS MDS Correction Policy referenced in this section. (l) The MDS assessment establishes the rate(s) at which  the Texas Medicaid program pays a nursing facility or hospice provider  for the facility's hospice residents to support the care the nursing  facility's residents receive and any information on the MDS RAI is  considered part of each corresponding claim for Medicaid reimbursement. (m) Prior to entering a nursing facility for review,  the OIG identifies a population of paid claims from which a sample  is drawn. (1) The population is defined as claims associated  with RUG classifications: (A) paid to the nursing facility, or hospice provider  for the facility's hospice residents, for a specified time period;  and (B) that meet certain criteria, such as dollar or claim  volume, as determined by the OIG. (2) The OIG identifies the population of paid claims,  along with their related RUG classifications and MDS assessment claim  forms, from which a statistically valid random sample is drawn for  review. The sample generated is a statistically valid random sample  generated at a minimum confidence level of 90 percent and a maximum  precision of ten percent. Related extrapolations are done at the lower  limit of the applicable confidence interval.  (n) Utilization reviews are conducted in accordance  with this subsection.  (1) OIG nurse reviewers conduct unannounced on-site  MDS utilization reviews of nursing facilities. The OIG selects nursing  facilities for an on-site review by conducting a comprehensive annual  review of all facilities, considering factors such as:  (A) length of time since the last on-site review;  (B) whether the nursing facility has ever been reviewed;  (C) previous review results;  (D) compliance history of the nursing facility;  (E) nursing facilities with claims in high-dollar reimbursement  categories such as rehabilitation, extensive services, and special  care services;  (F) variances in billing patterns;  (G) data analytics indicating potential fraud, waste,  or abuse; and  (H) complaints and referrals.  (2) The unannounced on-site review period begins when  an OIG nurse reviewer presents an entrance letter to the facility,  and ends when the OIG nurse reviewer informs the facility that the  unannounced on-site review is completed. The unannounced on-site review  period is subject to the provisions in subparagraphs (A) - (D) of  this paragraph. The unannounced on-site review period does not include  the exit conference, which is described in paragraph (3) of this subsection. (A) The nursing facility shall provide the OIG nurse  reviewer initial access to clinical records and resources the OIG  nurse reviewer determines are necessary to initiate the unannounced  on-site review process within two hours of entrance to the nursing  facility. Although the facility is not required to produce all records  within two hours, documentation to be reviewed must continue to be  made available to the OIG nurse reviewer during the unannounced on-site  review period. If the facility indicates that necessary records or  resources are located off-site or otherwise unavailable for immediate  retrieval, and the facility can substantiate this fact, the OIG grants  an extension to the two-hour initial production of records requirement. (B) The nursing facility, upon the OIG nurse reviewer  request, must provide the signed and notarized Records Affidavit described  in subsection (q)(4) of this section for each MDS assessment for which  copies of clinical record documentation are provided to the nurse  reviewer, attesting that the facility used its best efforts to obtain  all relevant records, and that the documentation provided to the OIG  nurse reviewer is as complete a compilation as was possible during  the unannounced on-site review period. If the nursing facility refuses  to provide the required Records Affidavit, the nursing facility must  state the refusal in writing and attach the statement to the records  provided to the nurse reviewer. (C) The nursing facility must ensure an assigned staff  member knowledgeable of the MDS and clinical record is available at  the facility to the OIG nurse reviewer during the entire unannounced  on-site review. (D) When the OIG nurse reviewer identifies an item  coded on the assessment that cannot be substantiated or does not accurately  reflect the recipient's status during the applicable look back period,  the OIG nurse reviewer notifies the assigned nursing facility staff  and requests supporting documentation. (i) The nursing facility must provide the requested  supporting documentation to validate the coded items to the OIG during  the unannounced on-site review period and prior to the exit conference. (I) If the unannounced on-site review period is more  than one day, the nursing facility must provide the requested information  during regular business hours to the OIG reviewer by the end of the  day the documentation was requested, provided, however, that the facility  will be allowed a minimum of six business hours in which to provide  requested information. (II) Nothing in this provision shall be construed to  affect the timing of an exit conference or require the reviewer to  incorporate an overnight stay near the facility. It shall be the facility's  responsibility to submit the supplemental records to the reviewer's  place of business. The reviewer's exit conference conclusions and  error rates may change after reviewing the supplemental records. Any  such changes are communicated to the provider within one business  day. (III) If a facility cannot produce or make available  the requested information, the facility must provide a written statement  explaining why the information cannot be provided as requested. The  submission of a written statement does not negate the OIG's authority  to take enforcement action under Subchapter G of this chapter. (ii) Lack of documentation to validate the items claimed  on the MDS as described in this paragraph may be the basis for an  error and RUG III group reclassification. (iii) Lack of documentation, inconsistent documentation  that misrepresents the patient's actual condition at the time it is  documented, or altered documentation, which does not follow generally  accepted error correction guidelines such as the MDS Correction Policy  in Chapter 5 of the Minimum Data Set, may be the basis for an error  and adjustment in the RUG-III group. The error or adjustment is made  based on a review of the clinical record documentation provided for  the look-back period of the MDS assessment. (3) The OIG nurse reviewer holds an exit conference  with nursing facility staff. (A) The exit conference is held with the nursing facility  staff at the conclusion of the unannounced on-site review period.  Hospice staff is encouraged to attend to discuss the review findings  of the MDS assessments for hospice recipients for whom the representative  provided hospice services. (B) The OIG nurse reviewer provides the nursing facility  representative(s) in a leadership position(s) (e.g., the administrator,  Director of Nursing, charge nurse) formal written notification of  all MDS validation findings during the exit process. (i) If a hospice representative is present at the exit  conference, written notification is provided only on recipients to  whom they provided services. Cont'd..."

(b) The OIG may exclude a person without sending prior  notice of intent to exclude in the following circumstances: (1) The OIG determines that the person is subject to  mandatory exclusion under subsection (a) of this section and the person  may be placing the health and/or safety of persons receiving services  under an HHS program at risk; or  (2) a person who is subject to mandatory exclusion  under subsection (a) of this section fails:  (A) to grant immediate access to the OIG or to a requesting  agency upon reasonable request;  (B) to allow the OIG or a requesting agency to conduct  any duties that are necessary to the performance of their official  functions; or  (C) to provide to the OIG or a requesting agency as  requested copies or originals of any records, documents, or other  items, as determined necessary by the OIG or the requesting agency. (c) When the OIG issues a final notice of exclusion,  the notice includes the requirements and procedures for reinstatement. (d) Due process.  (1) After receiving a notice of intent to exclude,  a person has a right to the informal resolution process in accordance  with §371.1613 of this subchapter (relating to Informal Resolution  Process) unless the exclusion is required under subsection (a)(1)  of this section or under 42 C.F.R. §1001.101.  (2) A person may request an administrative appeal hearing  in accordance with §371.1615 of this subchapter (relating to  Appeals) after receipt of a final notice of exclusion unless the exclusion  is required under subsection (a)(1) of this section or under 42 C.F.R. §1001.101.  The OIG must receive the written request for an appeal no later than  15 days after the date the person receives final notice.  (3) When the exclusion is based on the existence of  a criminal conviction; a civil fraud finding; a civil judgment imposing  liability by federal, state, or local court; a determination by another  government agency or board; any other prior determination; or provisions  within a settlement agreement, the individual or entity subject to  exclusion may not collaterally attack the underlying determination,  either on substantive or procedural grounds, in an administrative  appeal.  (e) Scope and effect of exclusion.  (1) An exclusion becomes effective on the following: (A) the date the person's health care services or items  became ineligible for federal financial participation as described  in subsection (a)(1) of this section;  (B) the effective date the person lost its license,  certification, or other qualifying requirement as described in subsection  (a)(2) of this section;  (C) the date of the criminal judgment of conviction  or date of order the person received for deferred adjudication or  pre-trial diversion as described in subsection (a)(3) - (5) and (8)  of this section;  (D) the date of the criminal judgment of conviction,  or effective date of the assessment of civil monetary penalties or  exclusion as described in subsection (a)(6) of this section;  (E) the effective date of final determination of liability  pursuant to Texas Human Resources Code §32.039(c) as described  in subsection (a)(8) of this section;  (F) the date of the final notice of exclusion if the  exclusion is based on a health or safety risk as described in subsection  (b)(1) of this section;  (G) the date of the original request for records if  the exclusion is based on failure to provide access as described in  subsection (b)(2) of this section; or  (H) if the exclusion is upheld at an administrative  hearing, the effective date is made retroactive to the applicable  effective date described in this section.  (2) An exclusion remains in effect for the period indicated  in the final notice of exclusion. The person is not eligible to apply  for reinstatement or reenrollment as a provider until the exclusion  period has elapsed. The minimum length of exclusion is determined  as follows:  (A) The minimum length of exclusion is the federally  mandated exclusion period plus one additional year if the exclusion  is based upon a conviction as described in subsection (a)(3), (4),  or (5) of this section.  (B) An MCO is excluded for the same period as the related  person was excluded, as described in subsection (a)(6) of this section.  (C) An individual is excluded for the same period as  the sanctioned entity in which the individual held an ownership, control  interest, or substantial contractual relationship as described in  subsection (a)(7) of this section.  (D) The exclusion is effective for ten years if the  exclusion is based upon an assessment of civil monetary penalties  pursuant to Texas Human Resources Code §32.039(c) arising out  of injury to a person who is 65 years of age or older, a person with  a disability, or a person under 18 years of age as described in subsection  (a)(8) of this section.  (E) The exclusion is effective for three years if the  exclusion is based upon an assessment of civil monetary penalties  pursuant to Texas Human Resources Code §32.039(c).  (F) The exclusion is permanent if the exclusion is  based upon a criminal conviction for committing a fraudulent act under  the Medicaid program that results in injury to a person who is 65  years of age or older, a person with a disability, or a person under  18 years of age as described in subsection (a)(8) of this section. (G) Unless otherwise provided, the length of exclusion  is determined by the OIG in its discretion. The OIG considers the  factors enumerated in §371.1305(c) of this chapter (relating  to Preliminary Investigation and Report) in determining the length  of exclusion.  (3) Unless a person is reinstated and re-enrolled as  a provider in the Texas Medicaid program, no payment is made by the  Medicaid program for any item or service furnished or requested by  an excluded person on or after the effective date of exclusion. (4) An excluded person is prohibited from:  (A) personally or through a clinic, group, corporation,  or other association or entity, billing or otherwise requesting or  receiving payment for any Title V, XVIII, XIX, XX, or CHIP program  for items or services provided on or after the effective date of the  exclusion;  (B) providing any service under the Medicaid program,  whether or not the excluded person directly requests Medicaid program  payment for such services;  (C) assessing care or ordering or prescribing services,  directly or indirectly, to Title V, XIX, XX, or CHIP recipients after  the effective date of the person's exclusion; and  (D) accepting employment by any person whose revenue  stream includes funds from a Title V, XVIII, XIX, XX, or CHIP program. (5) If, after the effective date of an exclusion, an  excluded person submits or causes to be submitted claims for services  or items furnished within the period of exclusion, the person may  be subject to civil monetary penalty liability under §1128A(a)(1)(D),  and criminal liability under §1128B(a)(3) of the Social Security  Act in addition to sanctions or penalties by the OIG.
